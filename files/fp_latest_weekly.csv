Yes, I know Aaron Jones destroyed this run defense last week, but since Week 11, this unit has played better. Over their last six games, Carolina has the 12th-fewest rushing yards per game allowed, the eighth-best stuff rate, and the seventh-lowest yards before contact per attempt given up.

It is clear that he will not be back with the Buccaneers next season, but with the team fighting for the top seed in the NFC South, they need to roll with their stud.
