Simmons would be a weekly DB1 if he qualified there, but instead, we are forced to wait for Yahoo to update his role, something which may not happen since he wears the green dot and practices with the linebackers. As a linebacker, he is too inconsistent to trust as much more than a low-end LB2/high-end LB3 as opposed to a DB1, especially now that he will be spending more time in coverage.
