Swift has a good matchup on the ground again this week, but I highly doubt that he can take advantage of it.

Among 106 qualifying receivers, he ranks third in separation score and first in route win rate, so don't think about trading him away. If anything, now is a great time to get Aiyuk on your teams.

Jeudy is the WR43 in fantasy points per game with a 17.2% target share, a 28.5% air-yard share, 1.05 YPRR, and an 18.8% first-read share. No receiving threat in the Cleveland offense will have sparkling efficiency numbers because the level of quarterback play has been so bad. I'm not attempting to excuse Jeudy here, but it's the truth. Watson is a backup-level quarterback at this juncture. The Raiders have the 10th-highest single-high rate in the NFL (57.1%). Against single-high, Jeudy's target share has dipped a tad to 16.4% while his first-read share has stayed consistent at 18.2%, so this coverage matchup does nothing to boost his Week 4 outlook as a meh-level flex play. The matchup is good, though, for what it's worth. The Raiders' secondary has allowed the ninth-most fantasy points per game to wide receivers. Jeudy will run about 63% of his routes against Jack Jones (69.2% catch rate and 126.0 passer rating) and Jakorian Bennett (38.5% catch rate and 55.6 passer rating).","sit",NA,"WR42","C","10.4"

Unfortunately, most people don't have better starting options at tight end, and the entire position is a wasteland, so if you have to start him, I get it. In the previous two games, Andrews at least had a 69% route share, but he still only managed a 9.3% target share, 1.05 YPRR, a 13.3% first-read share, and 6.3 fantasy points per game.
