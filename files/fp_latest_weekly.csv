I didn't watch Demercado in the predraft process this season, so I was curious about him. I did a brief film review of his carries in the NFL and college. What I saw was a back with good burst. A straight-line runner that gets North/South quickly. He has some bend, but he isn't a yards-creator. He doesn't have a ton of wiggle, but if you give him a crease, he has the bust and speed to hit home runs. He has an 83rd percentile speed score and 79th percentile burst score per Playerprofiler.com. Listening to the Cardinal's head coach speak about him, the team feels comfortable with him on passing downs, so I expect him to soak up that work while also factoring in on early downs. Los Angeles is a wonderful matchup for backs.

I won't put much stock in this in determining the workload for him versus Emari Demercado. Ingram will be back this week after being sidelined with a neck issue. He practiced in full on Friday and isn't listed with an injury designation. In the two career games, Ingram has played at least 30% of the snaps; he totaled 16 touches that he turned into 40 total yards. That's not great. Now, add in that across 76 career NFL carries (regular and preseason), Ingram has 2.11 yards after contact per attempt, and you can easily see how Demercado can finish Week 6 with more production and touches than Ingram. That said, the Rams have had major issues stopping the run this year. They have allowed the 11th-highest explosive run rate; the tenth-highest missed tackles allowed per attempt, and the seventh-highest yards before contact per attempt. Ingram might be the favorite for goal-line work among the two backs, but there's no way to know for sure. I wouldn't depend on that this week. If both backs are on the waiver wire in shallower leagues, Demercado would be the pickup. Week 6 Positional Value: RB4 with RB3 upside ",NA,NA,"RB45","D","5.7"

He is back in the DL1 conversation and should be treated as an LB2 option if you still play your IDP on a provider that has him listed as an LB only. Reddick is a stud who should be on as many rosters as Micah Parsons and T.J. Watt, even if he will never have the same name equity. Make sure Reddick isn't floating on your wire.
