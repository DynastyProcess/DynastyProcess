The rollercoaster that is Minshew can easily be seen in his numbers. Among 33 qualifying quarterbacks, he ranks dead last in passing grade with the highest turnover-worthy play rate, but he is also tenth in yards per attempt and 15th in adjusted completion rate. Crazy enough, I'm projecting that Minshew struggles this week against an airtight Saints pass defense. New Orleans has held passers to the third-lowest yards per attempt, the second-lowest passer rating, and the lowest adjusted completion rate. If Minshew defies my logic again this week, I'll have to start considering that he's made a deal with the devil or that his mustache has magical powers.

An injury and a slow start to the season have caused the talented Lloyd to lose some of his offseason luster, but he is starting to look like the top-20 option you were hoping for when you drafted him. However, in some leagues, Lloyd was cut loose and sent to the wire, and based on his rostership numbers, this has even happened in some competitive leagues. Lloyd is much too talented to give up on, even in redraft, unless you were simply facing an untenable roster crunch. Lloyd should be viewed as an LB2 with LB1 upside going forward and should be treated as such for a plus Week 8 matchup against a struggling Pittsburgh Steelers offense.","start",NA,"LB31",NA,"13.3"
