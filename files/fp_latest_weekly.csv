Taylor retains some rushing upside with 24.5 rushing yards per game in his full starters. He faces a Rams' pass defense that has surrendered some production because teams are forced to throw against them because their run defense is so damn good. Since Week 11, despite holding passers to the 11th-lowest yards per attempt and the eighth-lowest CPOE, they have surrendered the fifth-most passing yards per game and the most passing touchdowns.

His rushing production has helped cover up his recent passing struggles. Across his last five games, he has averaged 33.4 rushing yards with six rushing scores. His passing numbers haven't been as sexy. Since Week 11, among 40 qualifying quarterbacks, he ranks 13th in yards per attempt, 20th in passer rating, 32nd in CPOE, and 23rd in highly accurate throw rate. Yeah, that's not good at all. The last time Allen faced this pass defense, he completed 65.9% of his passes with two passing scores and one on the ground as the QB4 for the week. The Patriots are a pass funnel defense, as their run defense has been an elite unit all season. Their pass defense has played well in spurts this season, but overall, it's a middle-of-the-road group. Since Week 11, New England ranks 15th in passer rating and 20th in passing yards per game allowed while coughing up the eighth-highest CPOE. Allen can continue to get by with his rushing production as a strong QB1. Week 17 Positional Value: QB1",NA,NA,"DE6",NA,"15.8"

One of the bright spots on a defense that has seen better days, Yaya has recorded all of his 6.5 sacks since Week 7. The DL14 overall since Week 8, Yaya should be added and started wherever available. Start Yaya everywhere as a DL3 with DL2 upside for championship week, thanks to a plus matchup against a New Orleans Saints team surrendering the 15th most fantasy points per game to opposing edge rushers.","start","streak","DE23",NA,"12.0"
