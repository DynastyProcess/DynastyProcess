The Titans wisely built this wrinkle into the offensive attack and Levis responded with 9.6 yards per attempt and a 137.5 passer rating on play-action throws. Pittsburgh has yielded the seventh-highest yards per attempt (15th in play-action passer rating allowed) to play-action passes this season. This is an avenue that Levis could exploit, but he also has to contend with the Pittsburgh pass rush. They are fifth in pressure rate this season.

With Bagent, he has had a 12.1% target share, a 28.5% air-yard share, 1.28 YPRR, and a 15.9% first-read share. Mooney has only two red zone targets this season, so to pay off, he'll likely need to break a big play, but that's possible this week. The Saints have allowed the fourth-most receiving yards and the seventh-most receiving touchdowns (tied) to opposing slot receivers. Mooney will run about 73% of his routes against Alontae Taylor (66.7% catch rate and 100.5 passer rating). Week 9 Positional Value: WR5 with WR3 upside",NA,NA,"WR62","F","6.9"
