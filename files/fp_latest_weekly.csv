They were the ninth-slowest neutral-pace team in the NFL with the third-highest neutral rushing rate. Don't be surprised if New Orleans does the same thing in Week 4 with an even better defense backing Winston this season. In 2021, Winston ranked 24th in passing grade, 31st in adjusted completion rate, and 15th in yards per attempt. Tampa Bay has been a tough pass defense, allowing the seventh-lowest yards per attempt, the eighth-lowest adjusted completion rate, and the tenth-lowest passer rating. The one silver lining is their problems with stopping the deep ball. In 2021, Winston was 20th in deep-adjusted completion rate, but he had the seventh-highest deep ball rate, so New Orleans felt comfortable letting him take shots. That should also happen this week.

Hendrickson will find his way to double-digit sacks this season, but will come with peaks and valleys. He is not very active against the run, so when he is not notching sacks, he often disappoints with his fantasy production. With that said, he should be rostered in all competitive IDP leagues. He will have DL1 upside in the right matchups but will be more of a DL2 option due to said inconsistency.
