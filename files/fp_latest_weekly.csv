Perhaps motivated by playing in Miami, where he'd played his college ball for the University of Miami Hurricanes, Johnson rolled up 22-107-2 rushing against the Jets and caught one pass for 20 yards. But there are a couple of reasons to approach Johnson with caution in Week 16. First, it's hard to tell whether Johnson will continue to play a leading role or fall into a time-share with Myles Gaskin, who had been the starter until last week. Gaskin had just come off the COVID-19 list two days before Johnson's big day, and maybe that had something to do with Gaskin's lesser role. Second, Johnson shredded a bad Jets defense. This week, he'll face a Saints run defense that ranks first in DVOA and is giving up a league-low 14.4 fantasy points per game to running backs. Caution is advised here.
