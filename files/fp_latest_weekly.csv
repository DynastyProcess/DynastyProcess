He hasn't managed an explosive run yet while managing a nauseating 7% missed tackle rate and only 2.25 yards after contact per attempt.

He has played 71% of his snaps on the perimeter his season, and in the fourth quarter of last week's game, he played 80% of his snaps from the boundary. I could easily be wrong here, or the Bucs could move all three guys around the formation, but right now, I lean that McMillan will remain an outside receiver, so that's how I'm approaching his Week 8 outlook. McMillan will be thrust into a larger role moving forward, but it's worth questioning how effective he will be in the elevated role. McMillan has had a 7.1% target share, 0.70 YPRR, and a 7% first-read share. Among 109 qualifying receivers, he ranks 89th in separation score. McMillan has five deep targets and one red zone look this season. If possible, I'm sitting McMillan this week to see how this reshuffling of the guard works out. Atlanta has allowed the second-highest PPR points per target to perimeter wide receivers while ranking 19th in receiving yards per game allowed. The matchup is good, so if you're willing to embrace the risk and are in a flex pickle for Week 8, I get plugging him into a lineup.","sit",NA,"WR42","C","9.9"
