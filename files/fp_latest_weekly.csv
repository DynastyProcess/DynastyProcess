This year, the Ravens' defense ranks 24th in DVOA, and season-ending injuries to Dobbins and Edwards have forced Baltimore to try spackling the position with Latavius Murray, Devonta Freeman, Ty'Son Williams, and Le'Veon Bell. As a result, Jackson is being forced to throw more because game scripts haven't been as friendly and because the Ravens can't lean on their running game. Jackson has thrown 225 passes through seven games. He threw 190 passes in his first seven games last year. That's five more pass attempts per game, and at his current average of 8.5 yards per pass attempt, that works out to an extra 42.5 passing yards per game.

Edmonds comes in at RB21, Conner RB27. You could make the case that those rankings are overly conservative since the Cardinals might lean on their RBs more heavily with Murray banged up. But Edmonds and Conner face a pretty good 49ers run defense, and their TD chances could be compromised if Murray isn't at full capacity and doesn't move the offense as well as he normally does. Conner's ceiling could be especially diminished if Murray isn't 100%, since his 2021 value has been so TD-dependent.",NA,NA,"RB26","C+","9.3"

You're not complaining too much about the net result if you're a Hill stakeholder, but it speaks volumes about the surprising inefficiency of the Kansas City offense this season. For the record, Hill had one previous 18-target game and a 19-target game. He finished with 11-157-1 and 9-113-1, respectively, so maybe those high-target games simply aren't the scoring bonanzas for Hill we'd expect them to be. Even with the maddening inefficiency of the Chiefs' offense, Hill is certainly capable of going off in Week 9 against a Packers defense that's still missing ace CB Jaire Alexander.
