He tallied two solos, three assists, two sacks, two tackles for loss, and one forced fumble against Brock Purdy and the 49ers. Jones is playing under 50 percent of the snaps but could get some more burn if Dallas Turner misses extended time. Still, Jones is worth a look in deeper formats as a depth piece who could be thrust into a pass rushing role if he can keep providing splash plays for Brian Flores' defense. Add him as a DL4/bye week piece who can double as a DL3 in 16+ team formats.","start","streak","DE35",NA,"13.3"
