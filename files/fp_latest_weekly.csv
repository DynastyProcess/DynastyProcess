He hasn't managed an explosive run yet while managing a nauseating 7% missed tackle rate and only 2.25 yards after contact per attempt. These tackle-breaking numbers look like a discount version of Kareem Hunt's numbers. Despite that fact, Dowdle could post another solid day if Dallas feeds him the rock.

Well, here goes nothing. I don't know if McMillan's role as an outside receiver this season changes much with the shuffling of receivers. He has played 71% of his snaps on the perimeter his season, and in the fourth quarter of last week's game, he played 80% of his snaps from the boundary. I could easily be wrong here, or the Bucs could move all three guys around the formation, but right now, I lean that McMillan will remain an outside receiver, so that's how I'm approaching his Week 8 outlook. McMillan will be thrust into a larger role moving forward, but it's worth questioning how effective he will be in the elevated role. McMillan has had a 7.1% target share, 0.70 YPRR, and a 7% first-read share. Among 109 qualifying receivers, he ranks 89th in separation score. McMillan has five deep targets and one red zone look this season. If possible, I'm sitting McMillan this week to see how this reshuffling of the guard works out.
