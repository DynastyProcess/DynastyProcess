However, with Greg Rousseau healthy, Epenesa is third on the depth chart behind Big G and Shaq Lawson. Epeensa managed just 37 percent of the snaps in Week 13, a far cry from the 60 percent he saw back in Week 10 with Rousseau sidelined. He has been impressive this season on limited snaps but is not seeing enough of a role to trot out there in the final week of the fantasy season. Look elsewhere for your Week 14 DL3.","sit",NA,"DE39",NA,"9.1"
