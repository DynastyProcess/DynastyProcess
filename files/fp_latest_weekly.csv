The red zone snap rate I'm not freaking out about too much, as Miami didn't move the ball well all day, and they only had a total of seven snaps inside the 20-yard line. Achane looked arguably the best he has all season on a per-touch basis, with a 6.7% explosive run rate and a 20% missed tackle rate. He can continue to build upon last week's encouraging game this week against a run defense that has allowed the seventh-most rushing yards per game, the fifth-highest rushing success rate, and the 13th-highest yards before contact per attempt. Miami's offensive line had been a bottom-tier unit to being the season in run blocking, but they have at least pulled that up to respectable levels, ranking 15th in yards before contact per attempt.

Last week, he played 20% of the snaps with six touches and 38 total yards. He didn't log a snap in the red zone. That could change this week if Iriving is more limited, but I would be surprised if Tucker's snap share climbed into the mid-30s this week. Atlanta has allowed the ninth-most rushing yards per game, the 11th-highest missed tackle rate, and top-eight success rates to zone and gap runs.","sit",NA

This season, with Chris Godwin previously owning that role, Shepard had been on the perimeter for 71% of his routes.

His first-read share was only at 10%, which was third on the team, but I think that can change, considering how well he earned volume last week with little first-read action and zero designed looks. Franklin is a sneaky flex play this week with substantial upside. Carolina has allowed the highest PPR points per target and the fourth-most receiving yards per game to perimeter wide receivers. This secondary has also struggled to stop deep passing, allowing the eighth-highest deep passing yards, the seventh-highest passer rating to deep shots, and the fourth-highest CPOE to targets 20 yards or further downfield. 40% of Franklin's target volume has come via deep passing targets.
