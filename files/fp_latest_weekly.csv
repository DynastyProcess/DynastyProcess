He was elite again in Week 13, tallying six solos, one assist, two sacks, and one forced fumble. Uche now has recorded a sack in four of his last five games, with all seven of his sacks coming in that span. He saw a season-high in snaps and snap share in Week 13 and should continue to see an uptick now that he has proven that his breakout is not an aberration. Fire him up as a DL2 option while he is cooking. Those in Yahoo leagues should consider him an LB3 option until he cools down.","start",NA,"DE27",NA,"10.1"

The sack was just his second all season but may be a sign that he is ready to take off as an IDP contributor.
