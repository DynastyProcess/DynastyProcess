Week 1 didn't turn out that way. Jaelan Phillips and Bradley Chubb played 90 and 88 percent of the edge snaps, respectively, while Christian Wilkins and Zach Sieler played 84 and 80 percent. The Dolphins will not want any of those four playing that much on a consistent basis, but what this game did teach us is that they are capable of being snap hogs when gamescript calls for it. This is going to severely limit Ogbah's weekly upside and lowers his floor to that of a waiver wire player. He has double-digit sack potential, but without a role, he is nothing more than a deep league/dynasty stash. Look elsewhere for Week 2 despite the plus matchup against the New England Patriots.","sit",NA,"DE59",NA,"9.5"
