We'll see if that happens, but the talented young back has earned it. Last week, he played 38% of the snaps overall, 56% of the rushing play snaps, and 26% of the passing down snaps. McCormick finished with 14 touches and 65 total yards. He's only had 17 carries this season, but posting an 11.8% explosive run rate, a 24% missed tackle rate and 2.59 yards after contact per attempt is pretty, pretty good. With Alexander Mattison possibly returning this week, everyone's roles are up in the air, but I'll continue to update you on this situation as we get more news. This week's matchup isn't great, as the Bucs have massively improved as a run defense. Since Week 8, they have allowed the tenth-fewest rushing yards per game, the eighth-lowest explosive run rate, the ninth-lowest missed tackle rate, and the fourth-lowest yards after contact per attempt. Abdullah is an uneasy flex this week.","sit",NA,"RB36","C-","6.0"

He did play 40% of the red zone snaps. Vidal has looked serviceable when he has gotten opportunities, with a 4.5% explosive run rate and 2.55 yards after contact per attempt.
