The Ravens are finally utilizing him in a full spectrum role, which, to be honest, should have been the approach the entire season. Pittsburgh has been a tough matchup for perimeter wide receivers for most of the season, but since Week 5, they have allowed the seventh-most fantasy points per game to the position. Bateman's day could be ruined if Baltimore moves Flowers inside and leaves Bateman on the perimeter to contend with Joey Porter Jr. in shadow coverage.

The All-Pro has been disappointing this season, as his three sacks in this game topped his entire 2023-24 season total coming into the game. However, he proved last year that he is an elite talent and has remained a must-start DT option because of that. His Week 10 outburst puts him back on the DL3 map, but he is not yet ready for DL2 consideration.
