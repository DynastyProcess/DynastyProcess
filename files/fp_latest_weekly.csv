We've seen Williams be effective for fantasy football in the past with a large workload - remember the Super Bowl? - and there's absolutely a need for him for fantasy managers right now. With so much uncertainty and unknowns at the RB position right now across the fantasy landscape, any player that has the potential to see 15+ touches deserves to be in the top-20 conversation. With no Montgomery or Tarik Cohen in this backfield, Williams should easily hit that threshold this week and he deserves to be viewed as a mid-range/low-end RB2 as a result. Against the defense that's allowing the 7th most fantasy points to opposing RBs this season with 20.0 per game, Williams has top-15 upside in his first start. If you picked him up off of the waiver wire this week, he deserves to be in your starting lineup.","start",NA,"RB15","B+","14.4"

While Jones found the end zone last week, Fournette brought an extremely high floor for fantasy purposes and he was a solid play against the Patriots. While Fournette's fantasy outlook for week five hinges on Bernard's availability - which we do not have clarity on at the time of writing - he's moving up the rankings due to the fact that Bruce Arians finally seems to trust him to shoulder the workload for this offense.

Hill saw 12 targets against the Eagles and he turned that into 11 receptions for 186 and three total touchdowns. If you had Hill in your lineup, you most likely won your matchup with this performance. Moving forward to week five though, Hill has a much tougher task in front of him against the Bills secondary. The Bills are allowing just 97.2 yards per contest and only 10.0 fantasy points per game to the position. This number is skewed by the fact that they faced the Texans in week four, but this is still one of the most stout secondaries in the game and they're going to have a plan for how to contain Hill.
