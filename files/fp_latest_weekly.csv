Rousseau is now worthy of DL1 consideration and is just that for a tasty matchup against the Baltimore Ravens. Running quarterbacks always present extra sack opportunities, and after Deatrich Wise had a three sack performance last week, the Bills defensive front is expected to have a sack party.

Unfortunately for fantasy managers, he has not yet been able to follow up on the sack he tallied in his NFL debut. He totaled just three solos and two assists over the last two weeks and is going to be hard to trust before the byes hit. The snap increase is great to see, but until he is more active as a run defender, he is going to be totally sack-dependent. He is a DL4 option for deep leaguers, but for those who are required to start less than four DL options every week, he should be left on benches. The opportunity is there for Ebiketie to take advantage of, but we need to see some consistency out of players worthy of DL3 consideration.","sit",NA,"DE42",NA,"10.7"

It makes some sense that the Vikings do not feel their first round pick is ready for a starting job. Many players take time to transition to the pros. However, when the team's star safety Harrison Smith was ruled out for Week 3 due to a concussion, the expectation was that Cine would see some sort of role. That was not the case. Cine, who saw just one defensive snap in Week 2, played zero in Week 3, instead spending all of his time with the special teams units. Harrison Smith is practicing in full, which means both Cine and Josh Metellus are no longer worth consideration for Week 4 lineups. Cine should see a role at some point this season, but it has become clear that they are in no hurry to give their first round pick snaps until he proves he is overwhelmingly ready.","sit",NA,"S59",NA,"10.2"
