Assuming those fans are familiar with Lock's play, that's quite an indictment of Bridgewater. He actually ranks QB12 in fantasy scoring over the last two weeks, but his 622 passing yards and five TD passes over that span have been offset by four interceptions and seven sacks. Bridgewater's Week 6 numbers were artificially inflated by 22 fourth-quarter passing attempts, as the Raiders did a poor job of playing keep-away with a commanding lead. Not that Broncos head coach Vic Fangio is apt to cave into fans' demands, but the possibility of an in-game benching heightens the risk for any fantasy managers forced to bet on Bridgewater in Week 7. Plus, Bridgewater is now dealing with some sort of minor foot issue. He's going up against a staggering Browns defense that gave up four TD passes to Justin Herbert and Chargers in Week 5 and another four to Kyler Murray and the Cardinals in Week 7. Bridgewater isn't on par with those two premier passers, but this has been a different Cleveland defense than the one that terrorized Justin Fields and Kirk Cousins a few weeks ago.
