Herbert is on a tear, with 300-plus passing yards and multiple TD passes in each of his last three games. He'll be at home this week against a surprisingly respectable Giants pass defense that ranks eighth in DVOA and is allowing 6.7 yards per pass attempt. He could be without both of his top receivers, however, as Keenan Allen and Mike Williams are both on the COVID-19 list. It's not clear what their chances of playing Sunday might be.
