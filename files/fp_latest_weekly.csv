Atlanta should lean on their ground game this week against the Bucs.

Swift took back the red zone snap lead, too (54.5% vs. 45.5%). We found out last year that this coaching staff can't be trusted with running back usage and reporting. Well, it remains early in the 2024 season, but once again, we have been ""Eberflused."" Johnson rolls back into the desperation flex play or RB3 area code.
