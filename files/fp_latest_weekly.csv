After producing 108 yards from scrimmage in Week 1, Gibson was held to 73 yards in Week 2. Not a total disaster, but he'll have better days. McKissic's usage, meanwhile, is going to be a wild card throughout the season. We can't predict when and how often the Football Team will run a 2-minute offense. Washington head coach Ron Rivera and offensive coordinator Scott Turner seem to recognize that putting the ball in Gibson's hands is a +EV move, so McKissic isn't likely to match the 80 receptions he had last season. The Buffalo defense the two Washington backs will face Sunday stymied Steelers rookie Najee Harris in Week 1 and then completely took away the Miami running game in a Week 2 blowout. Consider Gibson a low-end RB1/high-end RB2 this week. His DraftKings price of $5,900 is very reasonable, and Gibson is talented enough to be a worthwhile play despite the daunting matchup.","start",NA,"RB13","B+","15.8"

Gallman hasn't suited up yet. It turns out the 1b to Davis's 1a was under our noses the whole time: Cordarrelle Patterson. We can be forgiven for not recognizing a 30-year-old converted wide receiver/kick returner as a potential RB asset, even though he backed up David Montgomery in Chicago last year after Tarik Cohen got hurt. Through two games, Patterson has 14-65-1 as a runner and 7-71-1 as a receiver.

Released. Javian Hawkins, an undrafted rookie free agent? Nope. Released. It looks like I was right about someone stepping forward to share the load with Davis, but I picked the wrong guy. I thought it would be Wayne Gallman, signed earlier this month. Gallman's NFL credentials aren't unlike those of Davis, and I thought they might split the workload almost evenly. Nope. Gallman hasn't suited up yet. It turns out the 1b to Davis's 1a was under our noses the whole time: Cordarrelle Patterson. We can be forgiven for not recognizing a 30-year-old converted wide receiver/kick returner as a potential RB asset, even though he backed up David Montgomery in Chicago last year after Tarik Cohen got hurt. Through two games, Patterson has 14-65-1 as a runner and 7-71-1 as a receiver. That makes him the RB10 in fantasy scoring (half-point PPR) or the WR21, depending on where your league has him eligible. Davis, meanwhile, is the RB30. He's collected 135 yards from scrimmage but hasn't found the end zone. The Falcons' passing game has mostly been a sinkhole, but head coach Arthur Smith is creating RB value in Atlanta. Maybe Patterson's usage won't stick, but someone has to share this backfield with Davis, and Patterson has done a pretty nice job of it so far. I have him ranked RB35 and WR44 this week.

But in Week 2, when a game that was 14-14 at halftime got away from Houston in the second half, Johnson led the Texans' backs with 26 snaps. This trio will be facing a Carolina defense that has allowed a league-low 93 rushing yards per game and just 2.7 yards per carry. Ingram has 40 carries on the season, while Lindsay has 13 and Ingram has only nine. But given the likelihood of a negative game script and the probability that rookie QB Davis Mills will be looking to check down when the Panthers turn up the heat, Johnson has some appeal in DraftKings' Thursday-night Showdown, since at $8,100 he's $1,800 cheaper than Ingram and $600 cheaper than Lindsay.

I don't have a good answer to this question, but I'll ask it anyway: Why is the low aDOT working for Rondale but not for Laviska Shenault in Jacksonville? Does it have to do more with the quality of the quarterbacking, the quality of the systems, neither or both? Again, I don't claim to have an answer, but I find it interesting that the analyst crowd curses Shenault's low aDOT but has no problem with (and almost celebrates) Rondale's low aDOT. Anyway ... I mostly just wanted to find an angle on Rondale other than his sub-50% snap shares not really mattering because the Cardinals are proactively trying to scheme up ways to get the ball in his hands whenever he's out there. I have him ranked as a high-end WR4 but will try to find ways to sneak him into as many of my lineups as possible.",NA,NA,"WR35","C+","12.9"
