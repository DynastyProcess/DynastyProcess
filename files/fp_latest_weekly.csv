In Weeks 1-9, in Daniels' full games played, he only once had less than eight rushing attempts and 35 rushing yards. I'm hoping we see Daniels look more like the ridiculously talented rookie that we have come to love, but I have my worries. If Daniels can bounce back, he should shred the Dallas pass defense.
