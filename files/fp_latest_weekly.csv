Admittedly, it isn't a question many people have been asking. They look at what Brady has accomplished and the outrageous collection of pass-catching talent around him and assume Brady is not only a safe investment for 2021 but an appealing one. Here's the thing: Brady is 44. Only three other quarterbacks have started regular-season games since the NFL-AFL merger: Steve DeBerg, Warren Moon and Vinny Testaverde. DeBerg and Moon started one game apiece at that age. Testaverde started six games for the 2007 Panthers. ""But Brady is the GOAT,"" you say. Well, sure, maybe. But consider the dramatic declines of two all-time greats. In 2009, 40-year-old Brett Favre threw for 4,202 yards and 33 TDs, finished QB3 in fantasy scoring and nearly led the Vikings to the Super Bowl. The next year, Favre's last, he averaged 193 passing yards a game, threw 11 TD passes and 19 interceptions, and has a passer rating of 69.9. In 2014, 38-year-old Peyton Manning threw for 4,727 yards and 39 touchdowns, and finished QB4 in fantasy scoring. The next year, his last, he averaged a career-low 224.9 yards a game, threw nine TD passes and 17 interceptions, missed six regular-season games with a foot injury, and had a passer rating of 67.9. Are we really so confident Brady won't suffer a similar fate at an even more advanced age? And yet, it's impossible not to like this spot for Brady. His supporting cast is superb. The Thursday-night opener is obviously a big spotlight game, and we know how Brady usually performs in big games. And the Dallas defense is in a state of transition, with a bunch of new starters and a pair of rookie cornerbacks likely to see ample playing time. We'll see if Brady can continue to defy Father Time for a full season, but it would be unwise to bet against him in Week 1.","start",NA,"QB5","A-","21.7"
