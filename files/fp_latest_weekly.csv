Warren is a player that I've been enamored with since training camp and prospect season. With that said, we're still in wait-in-see mode for him for fantasy purposes. Mike Tomlin's press clippings won't pay our fantasy league dues. I need to see him get more work in this backfield before I'm willing to consider him as anything more than a high-end stash. Warren has only two games all season where he's played more than 30% of the snaps. Warren has averaged 5.1 touches and 30.1 total yards. Warren has looked explosive anytime he's had opportunities ranking 22nd in yards after contact per attempt and eighth in PFF's elusive rating (minimum 15 carries). Yes, 75% of his carries have come against light fronts (5.0 ypc), but that's not much different than Harris (61%, 3.3 ypc).
