It's unclear whether Williams will be able to return for the Lions' Week 11 date with the Browns. Third-stringer Jermar Jefferson sustained a high-ankle sprain against the Steelers and figures to be out, so little-known special-teamer Godwin Igwebuike may be Swift's backup this week. That should mean another big workload for Swift, though probably a lot fewer than 33 carries, and hopefully greater usage in the passing game than we saw last week. Swift is the RB this week and a solid DraftKings investment at $7,000 considering the likelihood of at least 18-20 touches.",NA,NA,"RB7","A","16.9"

It wasn't all garbage-time work for Breida in a 45-17 win over the Jets, either - he had three receptions in the first nine minutes of the game. Breida can't be considered fantasy-viable just yet, but his involvement bodes ill for Breida and Singletary, neither of whom has topped 60 yards from scrimmage in any of Buffalo's last four games. Moss and Singletary don't have much appeal this week against a Colts run defense that's giving up 14.3 fantasy points per game to running backs and has allowed a league-low four TD runs this season.
