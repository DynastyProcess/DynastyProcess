Last week he played a season-high 48% of the team's snaps. Ingram was stuck in a fantasy value-sapping four-way committee in Week 2. The increased snap rate could mean he is over an early-season ankle ailment. Ingram could see 15 touches against a beatable Seattle defense. The Seahawks are tenth in rush EPA with the fourth-most rushing yards allowed per game. They rank 28th or lower in adjusted line yards, second-level yards, and open field yards. Ingram could have a field day with any targets he sees. Seattle is also 27th in DVOA against backs in the passing game with the fifth-most receptions and receiving yards surrendered. Ingram might be nearing Frank Gore status, but he's still quite effective. He's 26th (out of 57) in yards after contact per attempt and 22nd in PFF's elusive rating (minimum 15 carries).

Another concern to note is that Barton did not lose his snaps to another linebacker or excessive dime package looks.

His value may be short-lived as there has been no indication that Ryan's injury is of the severe variety, but he does have DB3 with DB2 upside value for Week 5.
