If Thornhill cannot go, the Chiefs will start intriguing rookie Bryan Cook, who came on in relief of the veteran when he went down with the injury. Defensive coordinator Steve Spagnulo is a big fan of his cerebral rookie, a sign that he should occupy an every snap role if Thornhill is ultimately ruled out. Cook will be playing the deep safety role, so his tackle count may be more sporadic than if he saw a higher percentage of his snaps in the box.
