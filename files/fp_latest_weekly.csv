Justin Fields is almost surely going to be a better NFL passer than either Bortles or Trubisky, and the chemistry between Fields and Robinson could develop quickly. But it's hard to stick with Robinson when he has 17-181-1 through five games, and with the Bears having attempted just 37 passes in their last two games.

Even further from a guarantee is the possibility that Gordon turns into a viable weekly starter for fantasy lineups at any point this season. If you have Gordon on your roster and you need someone who is actually contributing right now, you can drop him onto your waiver wire.
