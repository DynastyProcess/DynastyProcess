Last year, Chandler started a game against the Lions where he played 65% of the snaps with eight touches and 17 total yards. His touchdown in that game saved his week from utter disaster. We could see a repeat of that stat line in Week 7. Chandler remains one of the worst tackle breakers in the NFL. Among 61 qualifying backs, Chandler ranks 47th in explosive run rate, 55th in missed tackles forced per attempt, and 60th in yards after contact per attempt.
