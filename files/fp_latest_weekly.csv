Jones has been, and continues to be, the lead guy, but whereas the versatile Williams could play on either passing downs or early downs, Dillon is more of a banger whose contributions should come mostly on early downs. That might mean slightly less early-down work and more passing-down work for Jones - a good thing for his overall value since extra targets could give him a nice boost. Jones finished RB5 in half-point PPR scoring last year after finishing RB2 in 2019. Dillon played sparingly as a rookie but sparked excitement when he was forced into action in Week 16 and completely wrecked the Titans on a snowy night in Green Bay, rushing for 124 yards and two touchdowns.

With Le'Veon Bell and Devonta Freeman also lurking in this situation, plus Trenton Cannon already being on the roster, this could end up being a gross situation to sift through for fantasy managers. Murray is worth picking up and stashing at the bottom of your bench in case you have room, but I'm not going crazy with my expectations for him just yet.",NA,NA

I wasn't wildly confident in Davis before, and I'm even less confident after the Falcons' release of Qadree Ollison and their signing of Gallman. Ollison hadn't been able to gain any traction in two previous seasons with the Falcons, but Gallman is a credible NFL running back with credentials very similar to those of Davis. This seems like it's destined to turn into a committee, and don't discount a role for Patterson.",NA,NA
