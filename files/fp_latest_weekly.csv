Even in the first half of last week's game, before Detroit had blown Dallas's doors off, LaPorta only had a 56% route share. That's puzzling. Overall this season, he has a 66% route share, a 9.2% target share, 1.79 YPRR, and a 9.3% first-read share. These aren't the type of numbers that we thought we would be getting this season. LaPorta has been quite good when targeted, but Jameson Williams' ascension and breakout season are what has crushed him. Also, Detroit's love for leaning on the run game this season. LaPorta could have a bounceback game this week against a defense that has allowed the 12th-most receptions and the ninth-most fantasy points per game to tight ends.",NA,NA,"TE7","B","9.5"
