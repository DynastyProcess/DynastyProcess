In Week 1, this Pittsburgh backfield looked like it belonged to Harris. Warren had something to say about that in Week 2. His snap rate increased from 31% to 48% as he had 11 touches and 61 total yards. He led the way on passing downs with a 54% snap rate, and he dominated the red zone work with a 66% snap rate. The reality is this will be a fluid headache all year, as Arthur Smith loves to torture fantasy managers with his hijinx. Warren's tackle-breaking metrics state that he still isn't 100%, as he has yet to bust an explosive run or force a missed tackle despite ranking 18th in yards after contact per attempt. This is a tough matchup for Warren to improve his rushing efficiency. The Chargers have given up the eighth-lowest explosive run rate, the fourth-lowest missed tackle rate, and the sixth-fewest rushing yards per game.",NA,NA,"RB33","C","10.2"
