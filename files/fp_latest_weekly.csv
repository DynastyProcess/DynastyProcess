Could Jones absolutely go off in this matchup? 100%. Could he also fumble again and ride the bench the majority of the game? Absolutely. This situation in Tampa Bay has the potential to be one of the greatest situations for a running back in all of fantasy football, but the way Bruce Arians manages it just makes it a complete headache.

Absolutely. However, he produced like a rookie TE normally does in their first NFL game and that's fine. It takes TEs a bit of time to adjust to the speed of the NFL game with all that they're asked to do and Pitts is no exception. It's going to take him time before he starts producing like a high-end TE1. The encouraging part for fantasy managers is that he was aligning everywhere in this offense and they were clearly intent on getting the ball into his hands. Pitts logged 49 total snaps in week one with 12 coming inline, 23 snaps coming from the slot, and 14 out wide. He also finished with the third-highest team target share for the TE position in week one with 24.2%. There's enough to build upon moving forward, but we shouldn't be excited to play Pitts this week against the Bucs.

That happened this past week with David Njoku stepping in and seeing five targets to Hooper's three. Moving forward, there's simply not going to be the consistency that we need from Hooper to trust him in our starting lineups. If he were the sole option in this offense, he'd be in consideration for the top-12 TEs every single week. However, we simply don't know what we're going to get every week and that leads Hooper to fall outside of the top-15 in my TE rankings for week two. Njoku had a good game last week and could be the main receiving TE in this offense, but his usage isn't enough to trust him quite yet. Njoku only ran 16 receiving routes in week one, which isn't anywhere near enough for what we need to confidently start him, especially with Hooper in this TE room as well.
