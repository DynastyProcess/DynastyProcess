In Weeks 12-15, McLaughlin played 24-36% of the snaps weekly while leading the way with 44% of the rushing play snaps but only seeing 24% of the red zone snaps. During these three games, he averaged 10.6 touches and 54 total yards. Since Week 12, he has had a 10.7% explosive run rate and an 18% missed tackle rate, which has been strong numbers for the Denver backfield. McLaughlin is a decent flex play this week, but there's a low floor and tons of risk that come along with playing him. The Denver backfield is a dice roll weekly that usually doesn't end up paying off. Since Week 11, Cincy has allowed the 11th-most rushing yards per game, the second-highest explosive run rate, and the eighth-highest yards after contact per attempt.",NA,NA,"RB48","D","5.0"

He had three red zone targets during this span without scoring a touchdown. He hasn't gotten into the endzone since Week 9. Legette is a deep-league flex only, as he'll likely be third in the target pecking order this week behind Thielen and Coker. Since Week 11, the Bucs have allowed the 13th-most receiving yards per game and the 12th-most fantasy points per game to perimeter wide receivers.",NA,NA,"WR74","D-","6.5"
