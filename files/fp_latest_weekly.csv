Mayfield also has a bunch of tight ends he can throw to, and his WR corps might be pretty good if either Donovan Peoples-Jones or Anthony Schwartz steps up. The Browns' powerful running game makes their play-action passing game effective, and we saw Mayfield average a tidy 11.5 yards per pass attempt in the opener.

The first is Winston's lack of firepower at receiver. It wasn't noticeable in the blowout of Green Bay, but it could become problematic. The other is Sean Payton's annoying habit of using Taysom Hill at quarterback near the goal line. In the second quarter, Hill came in when the Saints were inside the Packers' 10-yard line. He threw a short pass to Tony Jones on 2nd-and-1 at the 6, and Jones was pushed out of bounds at the Green Bay 3. Winston came back in and threw a three-yard TD pass to Alvin Kamara on the next play.

Two plays later, Winston threw a one-yard pass to Juwan Johnson. The point is that Winston could have lost two TDs if Hill had been able to punch it into the end zone from short range.

He also looked awful at times. On his first interception, he threw across his body while on the run and badly missed his target. Later, he stared down his receiver and made an ill-advised throw into traffic - another interception. Things will get better for Lawrence ... eventually.

Moving forward, there's simply not going to be the consistency that we need from Hooper to trust him in our starting lineups. If he were the sole option in this offense, he'd be in consideration for the top-12 TEs every single week. However, we simply don't know what we're going to get every week and that leads Hooper to fall outside of the top-15 in my TE rankings for week two. Njoku had a good game last week and could be the main receiving TE in this offense, but his usage isn't enough to trust him quite yet. Njoku only ran 16 receiving routes in week one, which isn't anywhere near enough for what we need to confidently start him, especially with Hooper in this TE room as well. Njoku also falls outside my top-15 TEs on the week.",NA,NA,"TE17","D","7.4"
