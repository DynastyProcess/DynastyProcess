He looked awful last year, and though the Eagles' injury-riddled offensive line had something to do with that, Wentz played poorly by any measure. So far with the Colts, he's dealt with injuries to teammates and himself, toughing out the last couple of games on two sprained ankles, and has acquitted himself quite well. Wentz is on the verge of getting WR T.Y. Hilton back from IR, and all-pro guard Quenton Nelson is expected back soon as well, so things are looking up.

To go from just 12 snaps in week four to 37 snaps in week five is a massive swing and there's no guarantee now that that usage remains moving forward. With that being said, Jacksonville is absolutely a matchup where we should consider Gaskin for our starting lineups. The Jaguars simply cannot stop anyone on the ground and the scoring opportunities are going to be there for Gaskin.

Is it really a surprise that Bill Belichick and the Patriots, notorious for scheming to erase an opponent's top offensive weapon, chose to focus on Cooks? He's the Texans' most dangerous playmaker by far - their only one, really - and now he's due to make some plays. Cooks will be facing a Colts defense that's had trouble with small, fast receivers, giving up 4-100-2 to Tyler Lockett in Week 1 and 9-125-2 to Tyler Lockett in Week 5.
