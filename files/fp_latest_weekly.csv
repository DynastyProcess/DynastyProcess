Etienne is second in carries and sixth in targets. Among 47 qualifying backs, Etienne is 20th in explosive run rate, 23rd in missed tackles forced per attempt, and 26th in yards after contact per attempt.

Montgomery was still active in the red zone, finishing with a 40% red zone share of the backfield work last week (60% Gibbs). With Gibbs outpacing Montgomery in every facet, we have to come to grips with the fact that Montgomery's early season domination of the workload is likely gone. Montgomery still has been one of the best pure rushers in the NFL this season. Among 47 qualifying backs, he ranks 17th in explosive run rate, third in missed tackles forced per attempt, and third in yards after contact per attempt. His value is closely tied to what he produces on the ground moving forward, and this week could be tough. Since Week 5, the Bears have not allowed an explosive run. They also have the best stuff rate, the third-best mark in yards after contact per attempt, and have given up the fewest fantasy points via rushing.
