The man who Von Miller tapped as being special upon his arrival to the Bills has not disappointed and looks to be on his way to a Pro Bowl appearance, despite playing rotation-level snaps. The Bills continue to pull Von and Rousseau when they are up big, so the young pass rusher has never played more than 67 percent of the snaps and has been under 50 percent in three of seven contests. Big G tallied three solos, one assist, one sack, and one tackle for loss on 56 percent of the snaps, his highest mark since the thriller against the Baltimore Ravens.

However, he has played just 40 combined snaps over the last two weeks, which is less than he saw in Week 1 or Week 2. The snap share has climbed from 27 percent to 35 percent, but we would like to see him a little higher before trotting him out there on a weekly basis. With that said, Jason Pierre-Paul is now on the team and is a superior run defender, so we may see Houston stuck under 50 percent going forward. With that said, Houston is as hot as anyone and has at least one sack in four of five games this season. Treat him as a low-floor DL2 option against the Saints this weekend.
