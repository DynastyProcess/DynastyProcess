But there are a couple of reasons to approach Johnson with caution in Week 16. First, it's hard to tell whether Johnson will continue to play a leading role or fall into a time-share with Myles Gaskin, who had been the starter until last week. Gaskin had just come off the COVID-19 list two days before Johnson's big day, and maybe that had something to do with Gaskin's lesser role. Second, Johnson shredded a bad Jets defense. This week, he'll face a Saints run defense that ranks first in DVOA and is giving up a league-low 14.4 fantasy points per game to running backs. Caution is advised here.

Unfortunately, out of their bye week, MVS only put up 20 receiving yards on three receptions and fantasy managers had to watch Allen Lazard steal all of that production. With that being said, MVS rebounded again in a big way in Week 15 and he was able to finish with a 5-98-1 stat line. Rodgers is looking to get him involved in the offense and he comes with incredible upside each and every week. There's still no predicting if it's going to be MVS' week to shine or if Lazard is going to receive an increased workload. We can't lock MVS into our starting lineups due to his volatility, but he's certainly worth considering as a low-end WR3/high-end FLEX play this week due to the upside he provides.",NA,NA,"WR98","F","5.2"
