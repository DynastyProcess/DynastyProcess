He ranks second in route run per team dropback rate, first in Target share (19.3%!), and fifth in YPRR. I'm not trying to bury the lede, but he's also a special rushing talent, ranking sixth in missed tackles forced per attempt and 22nd in yards after contact per attempt. The Jaguars' run defense has been legit, but they have some exploitable weaknesses if Arthur Smith is willing to change things up this week. Jacksonville has held rushers to the third-lowest explosive run rate while they also have the third-highest stuff rate. Here's where things get interesting, though. The Jaguars have yielded the lowest yards per carry to zone runs, but they have permitted the fourth-highest yards per carry to gap runs (5.0). Robinson has only been used on gap runs on 28% of his attempts this season, but he has the fourth-highest yards per carry (6.9 nice!) on gap scheme runs. If Smith is willing to alter the run game plan, Robinson could have a huge day. The Jaguars will also allow production through the air for Robinson.

He has been stuck behind Uchenna Nwosu and Boye Mafe, which is a concern considering Mafe is a second-year man who managed just three sacks as a rookie. Taylor is also dealing with a leg injury that knocked him out of Week 3's contest, so even if he is active for Week 4, he is likely to be limited and see even fewer snaps than usual. Taylor is worth keeping stashed in deeper leagues, but he should be started absolutely nowhere for Week 4.","sit",NA,"DE50",NA,"10.3"

After disappointing relative to fantasy expectations for much of his Jets tenure, Whitehead is finally back to the DB1 conversation. The DB4 on the year, Whitehead, has posted DB1 numbers every week this season and figures to keep the good times rolling against the Kansas City Chiefs this weekend. The struggles on offense mean more defensive snaps for the Jets, which in turn means more opportunity for production. Treat Whitehead as a DB1 until he cools down.","start",NA,"S26",NA,"13.6"
