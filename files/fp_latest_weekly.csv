After being one of the biggest Dynasty busts in recent history, Penny has had opportunities to step up and take over this backfield in Seattle, but his inability to stay healthy has hurt his chances. Now that he's fully healthy, Penny stepped forward last week and absolutely shredded the Houston Texans run defense and reminded people of why he was highly regarded coming out of college. On 16 rush attempts, Penny rumbled for 137 yards and two touchdowns, and a top-5 fantasy finish on the week. Fantasy managers are going to be excited to play Penny again in Week 15 after last week's performance, but we should be extremely cautious with locking him into our starting lineups. He draws a matchup with the Rams defense this week that is allowing just 77.6 rushing yards per game to opposing RBs. Penny should see plenty of work again, but the scoring upside isn't going to be as prevalent as it was against Houston. He can be viewed as a low-end RB2/high-end RB3.","start",NA,"RB25","C+","13.3"
