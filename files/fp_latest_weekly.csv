Brown had a limited practice to open last week before back-to-back DNPs to close last week. Brown ended up playing last week. He played 87% of the snaps last week, drawing a 26.7% target share, a 48.2% air-yard share, and a 33.3% first read share with 2.15 YPRR. We'll see what the rest of the week looks like for his practice participation, but I'm currently projecting him to play in Week 13. Since Week 8, Pittsburgh has had the third-highest rate of single-high (66.7%). Brown has had a 27.4% target share, a 43.5% air-yard share, 1.97 YPRR, and a 33.3% first-read share against single-high. Brown's biggest worry is shadow coverage from Joey Porter Jr. Since Week 9, Porter Jr. has shadowed three times following Ja'Marr Chase, Amari Cooper, and DeAndre Hopkins on at least 76.5% of their routes. Only Chase managed more than 40 receiving yards in Porter Jr.'s (41.2% catch rate and 59.2 passer rating) primary coverage. Week 13 Positional Value: WR3","start",NA,"WR28","B","12.2"

Even if Goedert returns this week, the matchup isn't great for him. Since Week 7, the 49ers have utilized single-high on 57.5% of their defensive snaps, but last week, it climbed to 62.9% with Talanoa Hufanga out for the season. In Weeks 1-9, against single-high, Godert saw strong usage with an 18.1% target share, 1.41 YPRR, and a 21.1% first-read share. The issue is that the 49ers have been good at defending tight ends, allowing the sixth-lowest fantasy points per game, the lowest yards per reception, and the second-fewest receiving touchdowns per game. We'll see if he can give it a go this week, but even if he suits up, Goedert is only a low-end TE1 this week. Week 13 Positional Value: Low-end TE1 (if active)",NA,NA,"TE59","F","1.0"

Karlaftis is a monster when it comes to creating pressures, even if they do not always translate to sacks. 16th in the league with 46 pressures; his total is higher than names like Danielle Hunter, Haason Reddick, and Rashan Gary, all of whom have more sacks and are widely regarded as far superior players. His eight sacks on the season tie him with Nick Bosa and Denico Autry for 14th in the league. Suffice it to say that Karlaftis should not be available in any competitive leagues, even though the rostership numbers suggest that he is.
