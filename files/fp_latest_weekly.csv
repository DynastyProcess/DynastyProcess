McNichols led the way with 26 snaps, Peterson had 19, Foreman had 12. Peterson had a team-high 10 carries for 21 yards and a touchdown, but, um, he looked a lot like a 36-year-old running back who had been unsigned just a few days earlier. Let's just say the Titans aren't getting the Adrian Peterson who ran for 2,097 yards in 2012. McNichols had 7-24-0 rushing and 3-11-0 receiving. He's likely to remain in a passing-down role, and there's probably not much of a chance for him to become the Titans' lead back. The wild card here is Foreman, who had 5-29-0 rushing but didn't catch a pass. Foreman looked good on his handful of carries, running with the sort of burst and power he flashed when he ran for 2,028 yards and 15 touchdowns in his final season at the University of Texas in 2016. This is still an evolving situation. Peterson ranks RB35 this week in a bad matchup against a rugged New Orleans run defense.","sit",NA,"RB36","C-","7.8"
