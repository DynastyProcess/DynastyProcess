Gay was on the right side of the split prior to Week 3 but may now be on the 40 percent side of the equation if Nick Bolton returns this weekend. Bolton did miss practice on Wednesday and Thursday but still has a chance to suit up if he can get in a limited session on Friday. Even if Bolton is active, Gay has underwhelmed enough this season that he is hard to trust as anything more than an LB4, especially when Leo Chenal out-snapped him with the star linebacker sidelined.
