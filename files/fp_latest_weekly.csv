Unfortunately, since that point, Hockenson has only finished inside the top-5 again on the week just once! Additionally, he has also finished outside the top-12 TEs in six other games so far this season. With the team performing so poorly around him and the QB play being less than ideal, Hockenson has struggled to produce the types of numbers that we saw at the beginning of the season. With that being said, he's still absolutely worth playing every single week at the TE position due to his talent and his role in this offense. He only saw a 12% target share in Week 12 against the Bears, but he was able to cash in and find the end zone for the first time since week two.

Schultz has seen a 16.9% target share over the past two weeks combined, but we have to assume that that will drop down if Cooper and Lamb both return to the active lineup this week. It's a tougher matchup for opposing TEs regardless with the Saints allowing just 5.2 fantasy points per game to the position too, so we need to at least exercise caution with Schultz in Week 13.
