Without any sort of rushing ability, plus New England's commitment to their run game, there's virtually no upside with Jones unless they get engaged in a true shootout. With the way Tennessee has been playing recently, that's unlikely to happen here and we could see the Patriots lean on the run again. Jones is a fine option as a low-end QB2 that's unlikely to hurt your lineup, but he's not going to help push your Superflex roster over the top either.","sit",NA,"QB19","D+","16.5"

It hasn't quite mattered who's been playing QB for the Jets, Moore has simply produced regardless. There are reasons to be concerned about Moore's continued ascension now though that Zach Wilson is back at QB. It could have been that Moore was getting acclimated to the NFL game, but Moore was the WR116 through the first five weeks of the season when Wilson was the full-time starter. It seems crazy to say, but if we didn't have the No. 2 overall pick in at QB for the Jets, we might be ranking Moore as a top-24 WR this week.

He also averaged a ridiculous 4.14 Yards Per Route Run, which was second in the entire NFL last week only behind Justin Jefferson (min. 5 targets).
