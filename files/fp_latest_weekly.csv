Outside of Week 1, Waddle hasn't surpassed 8.6 fantasy points or 57 receiving yards in any game. The same issues that plagued Waddle last year have followed him into 2024. His talent and per-route efficiency is undeniable, but Miami isn't throwing him the ball. Even last week, with Hill clearly not 100%, Waddle only had a 21.4% target share and 23.5% first-read share. While both of those figures led the team last week, they should have been incredibly higher especially considering how hot Waddle started the game, but Miami seems reluctant to ever force feed Waddle the ball. I don't understand it because they will happily do so for Hill, but Waddle doesn't get the same treatment when all signs point to it making sense and being the likely optimal approach. Waddle remains a volatile weekly flex. The Raiders have been solid against perimeter wide receivers, holding them to the third-fewest receiving yards per game and the second-fewest fantasy points per game.",NA,NA,"WR33","C+","11.4"
