It was expected that Raheem Mostert and Sermon would divide most of the carries in a potent and alluring backfield. Mostert was indeed a prominent part of the picture in Week 1 - until he sustained a knee injury that wound up being season-ending. But Sermon was a healthy scratch, and instead of the third-rounder from Ohio State, it was another rookie, sixth-rounder Elijah Mitchell of Louisiana-Lafayette, who made noise. Mitchell played 35 of 55 snaps and carried 19 times for 104 yards and a touchdown (though he didn't see a target). JaMycal Hasty played 16 snaps, with his only carry being a three-yard TD run. He also had a 15-yard catch. The debate in fantasy this week has been whether Mitchell is worth the huge waiver expenditure it took to get him in FAAB leagues this week. A lot of fantasy managers believe Sermon is still the guy you want to have in this backfield. I touted Sermon throughout the offseason because I've seen the Shanahan family's zone-blocking scheme turn jobbers like Tatum Bell and Reuben Droughns into one-year wonders, while elite talents like Terrell Davis and Clinton Portis produced legendary seasons in it. If Sermon is an elite talent - and he sure looked the part at OSU last year - he could be an RB1 at a committee-back price. That could still be the case. But as a golfer, I also believe in playing the ball as it lies. For whatever reason, Shanahan used Mitchell over Sermon in Week 1, and then Mitchell proceeded to have a good game. It seems counterintuitive that Sermon would vault past Mitchell in Week 2. Sermon is an errant drive into the rough, and I'm not going to deceive myself about the reality of the situation by fluffing up a bad lie. I have Mitchell ranked RB23 this week and RB22 in the rest-of-season rankings. Sermon is RB48 this week and RB40 rest of season.

It was expected that Raheem Mostert and Sermon would divide most of the carries in a potent and alluring backfield. Mostert was indeed a prominent part of the picture in Week 1 - until he sustained a knee injury that wound up being season-ending. But Sermon was a healthy scratch, and instead of the third-rounder from Ohio State, it was another rookie, sixth-rounder Elijah Mitchell of Louisiana-Lafayette, who made noise. Mitchell played 35 of 55 snaps and carried 19 times for 104 yards and a touchdown (though he didn't see a target). JaMycal Hasty played 16 snaps, with his only carry being a three-yard TD run. He also had a 15-yard catch. The debate in fantasy this week has been whether Mitchell is worth the huge waiver expenditure it took to get him in FAAB leagues this week. A lot of fantasy managers believe Sermon is still the guy you want to have in this backfield. I touted Sermon throughout the offseason because I've seen the Shanahan family's zone-blocking scheme turn jobbers like Tatum Bell and Reuben Droughns into one-year wonders, while elite talents like Terrell Davis and Clinton Portis produced legendary seasons in it. If Sermon is an elite talent - and he sure looked the part at OSU last year - he could be an RB1 at a committee-back price. That could still be the case. But as a golfer, I also believe in playing the ball as it lies. For whatever reason, Shanahan used Mitchell over Sermon in Week 1, and then Mitchell proceeded to have a good game. It seems counterintuitive that Sermon would vault past Mitchell in Week 2. Sermon is an errant drive into the rough, and I'm not going to deceive myself about the reality of the situation by fluffing up a bad lie. I have Mitchell ranked RB23 this week and RB22 in the rest-of-season rankings. Sermon is RB48 this week and RB40 rest of season. Hasty is unplayable for now, but with all the Shanahanagans going on in this backfield, who knows? He could be the hot waiver add next week.",NA,NA,"RB50","F","6.4"

Njoku had a good game last week and could be the main receiving TE in this offense, but his usage isn't enough to trust him quite yet.
