Bigsby began the season as a part-time player who earned more work and didn't contribute much to passing downs before seeing more passing down snaps with Travis Etienne getting hurt. My guess is that we see Bigsby on the early downs, with Etienne handling some of the early down work while taking the bulk of the passing down snaps. Bigsby has been awesome as a rusher this season, ranking fifth in explosive run rate and first in yards after contact per attempt (minimum 50 carries). Since Week 7, Houston has allowed the fourth-highest explosive run rate and yards after contact per attempt. Overall, this season, the Texans have given up the fourth-highest explosive run rate, the tenth-highest yards after contact per attempt, and the 13th-highest yards per carry to gap runs (Bigsby 50.5% gap).","sit",NA,"RB39","C-","6.6"
