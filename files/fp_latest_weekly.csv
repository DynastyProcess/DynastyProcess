No, but this is where we are. The biggest problem ailing Robinson isn't even any of the thorns that I've already discussed. It's his offensive line. They went from blowing the doors off of defensive lines to not being able to stop a light breeze. The offensive line's yards before contact per attempt have been the fourth-lowest in the NFL since Week 5.

The Buccaneers have kept backs in check, yielding the seventh-lowest explosive run rate and ninth-lowest missed tackles per attempt. They also have the 11th-best stuff rate. The one area of vulnerability for Tampa Bay has been defending zone runs.
