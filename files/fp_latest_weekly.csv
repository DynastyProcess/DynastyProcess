Since Week 11, they have held backs to the 11th-fewest rushing yards per game, fourth-fewest explosive run rate, and the 12th-fewest yards after contact per attempt.",NA,NA,"RB21","B","13.1"

Across the last six games, Metcalf has three end-zone targets and two red-zone targets. Metcalf could have a wonderful bounce-back game this week. Since Week 10, Chicago has had the eighth-highest single-high rate (59.7%). Since Week 11, against single-high, Metcalf has had a 26.5% target share, 2.23 YPRR, and a 39.6% first-read share. Metcalf should also lead the charge with downfield passing. Since Week 11, he has led the team with ten deep targets. Since Week 11, Chicago has allowed the sixth-most PPR points per target to perimeter wide receivers.",NA,NA,"WR32","C+","12.9"
