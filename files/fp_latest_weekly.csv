The rollercoaster that is Minshew can easily be seen in his numbers. Among 33 qualifying quarterbacks, he ranks dead last in passing grade with the highest turnover-worthy play rate, but he is also tenth in yards per attempt and 15th in adjusted completion rate. Crazy enough, I'm projecting that Minshew struggles this week against an airtight Saints pass defense. New Orleans has held passers to the third-lowest yards per attempt, the second-lowest passer rating, and the lowest adjusted completion rate. If Minshew defies my logic again this week, I'll have to start considering that he's made a deal with the devil or that his mustache has magical powers.

Adams is suddenly a must-start in Week 8, regardless of who lines up under center for the New York Giants. Yes, there is a lot more upside with the $160,000,000 dollar man under center, but expect the Giants to hold him out as long as possible as Tyrod Taylor gives them a much, much better chance to win and is a better fit for the offense.","sit",NA,"S46",NA,"11.4"

The Arizona Cardinals decided to release breakout safety K'Von Wallace in favor of Andre Chachere. Both were liabilities in coverage this season, but with Budda Baker back in the lineup, that wouldn't be as much of an issue as Wallace was set to see more box snaps. Perhaps the team is ready to move Jalen Thompson back to safety and promote 2023 third round pick Garrett Williams to starter at nickel. That would at least be a move that was potentially made with the best interests of the team in mind. However, last week, Chachere played every snap. Whatever the rationale, outside of a solid six solo performance last week, Chachere has not been productive enough to consider on a non bye, and with his role potentially in flux, taking the week to monitor his usage and role is suggested. Look elsewhere for your Week 8 DB3/flex1.","sit",NA,"CB32",NA,"10.6"
