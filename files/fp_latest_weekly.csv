This type of usage for Smith has been bonkers, but I don't see this continuing with Tua Tagovailoa back in the huddle. With Tyler Huntley under center, Miami's talented wide receivers were marginalized. I don't see that happening again in Week 8 with Tagovailoa. Smith still belongs on the streaming radar with a strong matchup incoming. Arizona has allowed the eighth-most receiving yard and the 13th-most fantasy points per game to tight ends.","sit",NA,"TE20","D-","7.8"
