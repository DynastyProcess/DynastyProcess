To go from just 12 snaps in week four to 37 snaps in week five is a massive swing and there's no guarantee now that that usage remains moving forward. With that being said, Jacksonville is absolutely a matchup where we should consider Gaskin for our starting lineups. The Jaguars simply cannot stop anyone on the ground and the scoring opportunities are going to be there for Gaskin.

There are two ways that players can reach that top-tier fantasy finish though...one can be by providing big performances here or there spattered throughout the season, but they may have disappeared some weeks. This is most famously exemplified by a player like Tyler Lockett. The other way that players finish as a top-12 option at their respective position is by being incredibly consistent week in and week out. They might not always provide huge week-winning performances, but there's a lot to be said for knowing what you're going to get when you put someone in your starting lineup. Hopkins is a perfect example of the second way to finish as a top-tier fantasy asset. Outside of his game against Jacksonville this year - where he most likely wasn't 100% - Hopkins hasn't finished with less than 54 receiving yards in any single game. Despite consistently drawing the toughest coverage on the defense, he's continued to produce rock-solid numbers. It may not be always to the level of what we thought we were getting when we drafted Nuk as a top-5 WR, but he's going to absolutely finish as a top-tier option at the end of the year. In this matchup against Cleveland this week that just got torched by the Chargers passing game, Hopkins can be viewed as a mid-range/low-end WR1.",NA,NA,"WR9","A","17.7"

This week against Washington, there's the potential that Hardman has a good game, but there's also a strong possibility that he's not needed much here in a game that Kansas City should be able to win fairly easily. If you do plug Hardman into your starting lineup, you're going to be left hoping that he finds the end zone. Otherwise, we could be looking at a disappointing performance.
