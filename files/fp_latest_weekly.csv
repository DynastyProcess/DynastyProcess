The man who Von Miller tapped as being special upon his arrival to the Bills has not disappointed and looks to be on his way to a Pro Bowl appearance, despite playing rotation-level snaps. The Bills continue to pull Von and Rousseau when they are up big, so the young pass rusher has never played more than 67 percent of the snaps and has been under 50 percent in three of seven contests. Big G tallied three solos, one assist, one sack, and one tackle for loss on 56 percent of the snaps, his highest mark since the thriller against the Baltimore Ravens.

He now has four sacks in his last two games, making him one of the hottest pass rushers in the NFL. However, he has played just 40 combined snaps over the last two weeks, which is less than he saw in Week 1 or Week 2. The snap share has climbed from 27 percent to 35 percent, but we would like to see him a little higher before trotting him out there on a weekly basis. With that said, Jason Pierre-Paul is now on the team and is a superior run defender, so we may see Houston stuck under 50 percent going forward. With that said, Houston is as hot as anyone and has at least one sack in four of five games this season. Treat him as a low-floor DL2 option against the Saints this weekend.

He made the most of the extra snaps, racking up two solos, two assists, two sacks, and two tackles for loss. New Orleans surrendered significant draft capital to acquire Davenport on draft night, so he has been getting an extended look, but Payton, also a first round pick, may have passed him for good. Start him as a DL3 with DL2 upside for a plus Week 9 matchup against a Baltimore Ravens team allowing the 14th most fantasy points per game to the position.

For reference, Malik Harrison, the Ravens number two linebacker, played just 56 percent of the snaps in Week 8. Queen should stick around the 70-80 percent mark for Week 8, but if Roquan, who is coming from an odd front, can pick up the defense quickly, we could see Queen under the 60 percent barrier as soon as this weekend.

The snaps alone usually keep you tethered to the conversation, but Scott, even with the heavy bye, should be viewed as more of a desperation DB4 than anything resembling a DB3. Scott has recorded four or more solos just twice all season and, with only one pick to his name, needs to contribute in the peripherals more to make up for his low tackle count. Look elsewhere for a Week 9 DB3 option.","sit","streak"
