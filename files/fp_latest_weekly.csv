The grizzled fantasy veterans who were playing in the early 2000s experienced something similar with Marshall Faulk, Priest Holmes, and LaDainian Tomlinson, giants of the era who routinely produced mammoth seasons and carried fantasy teams to championships almost singlehandedly. But there have been few saviors at the RB position in the generation since, so perhaps the young'uns are more in awe of Henry's greatness than the graybeards are. At the moment, the point differential between Henry and the RB2 in half-point PPR fantasy scoring is greater than the pint differential between the RB2 (Austin Ekeler) and the RB16 (Antonio Gibson). This week, Henry should feast on a Chiefs defense that ranks 31st in DVOA against the run and is giving up 5.2 yards per carry.",NA,NA

It seemed as if Gaskin might have regained control of this backfield in Week 5, when he played 69% of the offensive snaps and had 10 catches for 74 yards and two touchdowns. That now appears to have been either a mirage or an opponent-specific gameplan against a Buccaneers defense that's impregnable against the run but can be had through the air. Last week, Gaskin played the same number of snaps as Brown (a 36% snap share for each) and had 5-9-0 rushing and 2-5-0 receiving. Woof. Even with six teams on bye, Gaskin is just a high-end RB3 this week. Ahmed, who at times looks like he has the most juice of anyone in this backfield, played 27% of the snaps in Week 6 and had a season-high seven carries. He's the RB44. Brown has had at least five carries in all five of the games he's played this year, but never more than eight. He's the RB45. I'm not touching any of these guys in DFS.",NA,NA
