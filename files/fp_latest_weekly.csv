Just to make this clear, I have zero confidence in playing any Chicago running back right now. The Bears running back rotation has been unpredictable. Johnson played 74% of the snaps with 15 touches and 75 total yards in Week 12, only to see a 28% snap rate the following week. Last week, he played 49% of the snaps with nine touches and 60 total yards. Among 61 qualifying backs, Johnson ranks 42nd in missed tackles forced per attempt and 37th in yards after contact per attempt. If Johnson gets a similar workload to last week, he should be a strong flex play this week in a plus matchup. Since Week 10, Arizona has been unable to stop the run, allowing the seventh-highest explosive run rate, the most rushing yards per game, and the 10th-highest yards after contact per attempt.
