He's averaged 16.5 touches and 67.9 total yards this season while relying on touchdowns (four total, eighth-most). He saved his day last week with two scores, but his role is slowly starting to dry up. Over the last three games, he has drawn only one target through the air, and finally, in Week 7, the route run rate flipped in Pollard's direction. Elliott is 50th in yards per touch, 43rd in juke rate, and 54th in yards created per touch. I would love to say the juicy matchup with the Bears' run defense vaults him into RB2 territory, but outside of his two luck-boxed touchdowns in Week 7, he face-planted against the Lions' hapless run defense with 3.8 yards per carry. Zeke is dealing with a knee sprain and has been listed as doubtful. I don't think Elliott plays this week.",NA,NA,"RB68","D-","3.0"
