In the two career games, Ingram has played at least 30% of the snaps; he totaled 16 touches that he turned into 40 total yards. That's not great. Now, add in that across 76 career NFL carries (regular and preseason), Ingram has 2.11 yards after contact per attempt, and you can easily see how Demercado can finish Week 6 with more production and touches than Ingram. That said, the Rams have had major issues stopping the run this year. They have allowed the 11th-highest explosive run rate; the tenth-highest missed tackles allowed per attempt, and the seventh-highest yards before contact per attempt. Ingram might be the favorite for goal-line work among the two backs, but there's no way to know for sure. I wouldn't depend on that this week.

He is back in the DL1 conversation and should be treated as an LB2 option if you still play your IDP on a provider that has him listed as an LB only.

Butler is stepping into a high-value role with plenty of positive gamescipt to help him along.
