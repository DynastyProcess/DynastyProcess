While the likely outcome is Montgomery soaks up most of Herbert's volume, it's possible Ebner can work into the mix and eat away 8-10 touches weekly. Unlike Herbert, Ebner has a strong receiving acumen which could lead to him working into the passing downs more than Herbert ever did.","sit",NA,"RB56","F","3.8"

He was impressive with his added opportunity, racking up three solos, one sack, one tackle for loss, one forced fumble, and two passes defended. He is still part of a rotation that includes Shaq Lawson, Boogie Basham, and Von Miller, but Rousseau's absence leaves a massive snap hole to fill, and Epenesa was the biggest beneficiary in Week 10. Treat him as a DL3 for a neutral Week 11 matchup against a Cleveland Browns team allowing the 22nd most fantasy points per game to the position. Start Epenesa if you find yourself in a bye-week pinch.","start","injury","DE37",NA,"10.8"
