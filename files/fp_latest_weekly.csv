It's mostly about volume: Mayfield is averaging only 28.1 pass attempts per game. The Browns want to run the ball as much as possible, and it's easy to do when they get a positive game script, as they did last week in a 41-16 blowout of the Bengals. The Browns only ran 44 offensive plays in that game, and Mayfield attempted only 21 passes. He managed to salvage a respectable fantasy point total with hyper-efficiency, turning 14 completions into 218 yards and two TDs. The passing volume could go up for Mayfield this week with Nick Chubb on the COVID-19 list and Kareem Hunt still out with a calf injury. Mayfield is the QB22 this week against a good New England pass defense that has more interceptions (13) than TD passes allowed (12).","sit",NA,"QB21","D","15.6"

He's still an explosive back whose dual run-catch production adds to his fantasy appeal, but Jones has averaged just 12.5 carries a game since Week 4, as Dillon has carved out an increasingly larger role. Jones lands at RB7 in the rankings this week against a Seattle defense that's giving up 23.3 fantasy points per game to running backs, the third-highest total in the league. Dillon has scored only one touchdown this season, and the Packers are still using Jones as their goal-line back. The good news is that Dillon is averaging 68.5 yards per game and has been surprisingly good as a pass-catcher, hauling in 14 of 16 targets on the year for 134 yards and his lone TD.

McNichols led the way with 26 snaps, Peterson had 19, Foreman had 12. Peterson had a team-high 10 carries for 21 yards and a touchdown, but, um, he looked a lot like a 36-year-old running back who had been unsigned just a few days earlier. Let's just say the Titans aren't getting the Adrian Peterson who ran for 2,097 yards in 2012. McNichols had 7-24-0 rushing and 3-11-0 receiving. He's likely to remain in a passing-down role, and there's probably not much of a chance for him to become the Titans' lead back. The wild card here is Foreman, who had 5-29-0 rushing but didn't catch a pass. Foreman looked good on his handful of carries, running with the sort of burst and power he flashed when he ran for 2,028 yards and 15 touchdowns in his final season at the University of Texas in 2016. This is still an evolving situation. Peterson ranks RB35 this week in a bad matchup against a rugged New Orleans run defense.","sit",NA,"RB37","C-","7.7"

I don't think we have to worry about Deebo getting caught in a target squeeze. He's averaging 10.1 targets a game and hasn't seen fewer than eight targets in any game this season.
