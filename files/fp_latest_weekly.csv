He finished with eight touches and 35 total yards. It's tough to get excited about playing Bigsby right now, considering the state of this offense. There hasn't been a ton of passing volume directed to the running back position (Jags have the fifth-lowest target share to the running back position, 14.4%), a consistent commitment to running the football, and the overall offensive environment has been downgraded considerably with Mac Jones under center. Bigsby is a touchdown-dependent RB3 who is likely better off on your bench this week. Since Week 8, Tennessee has ranked 16th in explosive run rate and 15th in missed tackle rate while allowing the tenth-lowest yards after contact per attempt.","sit",NA,"RB31","C","7.7"

I expect him to lead the backfield in touches again this week, but if you told me that Kimani Vidal took over as the lead back this week, I wouldn't be shocked at all.
