The team only had one snap in the red zone in the second half, so I wouldn't go nuts with that fact. I expect Mattison to handle the early down work this week and get some red zone snaps, but the game script will likely dictate how much red zone usage he sees. Among 61 qualifying backs, Mattison ranks 41st in missed tackles forced per attempt and 46th in yards after contact per attempt.

It's difficult to trust Coleman this week after looking at that usage, but if you are in a bind this week, there's an avenue for him to be a solid play. It comes down to how much risk you are willing to absorb this week because Coleman carries a lot. Since Week 9, New England has had the fifth-highest single-high rate (61.8%). This season against single high, Coleman has had an 18% TPRR and a team-leading 2.94 YPRR while also ranking second in FD/RR (0.110). I don't see Coleman seeing Christian Gonzalez much this week. If Cooper is out there, I expect Gonzalez to follow him. Every corner on New England's roster without the last name of Gonzalez has been league-average or worse this season. That's why, despite how good Gonzalez has been, New England has still allowed the 11th-most PPR points per target to perimeter wide receivers. This is a good opportunity for Buffalo to feature Coleman. The talented rookie will be needed if Buffalo wants to make a deep postseason run. This game could be a confidence builder for him.","sit",NA,"WR56","D+","9.1"
