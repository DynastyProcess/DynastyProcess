But like in Week 2, Ekeler racked up a ton of receptions - 8 catches for 48 yards - to salvage his fantasy day. Even so, the constant effort to get guys like Michel and Kelley involved might hurt Ekeler's fantasy value in the long term. His overall volume won't be the same as last season when he scored 20 TDs. But Week 4's matchup versus the Texans is juicy, as their defense cannot stop the run. No team has allowed more rushing yards per game (202.3) than Houston. And it's by a wide margin compared to the second-worst team (Chicago Bears, 157). So I'd be looking to sell high after this game if possible. But don't pass up a deal if you can get one done this week. Can't forget that Chargers stud tackle Ra'Shawn Slater is out for the season.
