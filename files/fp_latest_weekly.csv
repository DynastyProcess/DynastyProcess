Henry only forced missed tackles on 8% of his rushing attempts with 1.77 yards after contact per attempt in Week 1. Neither of these numbers are fantastic by any stretch of the imagination, but let's keep it real. It was one game, so don't hit the panic button just yet. The Ravens are heavy favorites this week, so Henry should get more work in Week 2. If the Raiders are as bad as their Week 1 showing as a run defense, they could be in trouble this year.

Cook also received the only carry inside the five-yard line while he split the inside the ten-yard line work with Allen (two rushing attempts for each). Cook also dominated the red zone snaps for the backs with 52.9%. Among 34 qualifying backs, Cook ranked 15th in explosive run rate and 11th in missed tackles forced per attempt in Week 1. Miami's Week 1 showing as a run defense gives Cook hope. Last week, the Dolphins allowed the eighth-highest explosive run rate and the 11th-highest missed tackle rate. This stands opposed to their 2023 ranks, where they were stifling to rushing attacks, holding teams to bottom five metrics in explosive run rate, missed tackles, and yards after contact per attempt.

His 18.9% target share sent a tingling feeling throughout my entire body as Achane rolled up most of his yards through the air (76). Achane should find more running room in Week 2. Buffalo allowed the third-highest explosive run rate in Week 1. Last year, their run defense was the weak link of their defense, giving up the seventh-highest explosive run rate, the fourth-highest yards after contact per attempt, and the 12th-highest yards per carry to gap runs (Week 1 Achane 60% gap). Buffalo also allowed the 11th-most receptions and the fifth-highest yards per reception to backs last season, so Achane should be able to take advantage through the air as well if he is active.

I'm willing to explain this away as small sample variance, as Conner was one of the most efficient running backs in the NFL last year on a per-touch basis. It was good to see that his offensive line got a decent push up front, ranking seventh-best in yards before contact per attempt. The Rams defensive line got pushed around last week by the Lions, allowing the third-highest yards before contact per attempt. If the Cards line is for real they could open up holes again this week for Conner. The Rams also had the second-lowest stuff rate and the ninth-highest missed tackle rate last week.

Dowdle also didn't have an explosive run or missed tackle forced while also being stuffed on 50% of his runs with 2.13 yards after contact per attempt. Dowdle is also a sit this week in a terrible matchup for the Dallas ground game. Last week, New Orleans allowed zero explosive runs, only a 10% missed tackle rate, and 1.40 yards after contact per attempt. This lines up with their numbers last year, as the Saints were 17th in explosive run rate with the 11th-highest stuff rate and the fifth-lowest rushing touchdown rate allowed.","sit",NA,"RB40","D+","8.6"

Wilson can take advantage of this matchup if called upon this week if Achane is out. In that scenario, I would expect Wilson to lead the backfield, especially playing on passing downs, as Jaylen Wright factors in on early downs to share the workload. The Bills are a softer matchup on the ground. Last year, they gave up the seventh-highest explosive run rate, the fourth-highest yards after contact per attempt, and the 6th-highest yards per carry to zone runs (2023: Wilson 56.1% zone).

Wright is a dice roll flex this week if Achane is out. If Achane is active, then Wright isn't on the fantasy viability radar because his role would be up in the air and could just be a handful of snaps. This preseason, Wright handled 17 carries, which he turned into 91 rushing yards (5.4 ypc). Those numbers look better than his per-touch efficiency. Among 108 preseason rushers, Wright ranked 52nd in yards after contact per attempt and 58th in elusive rating. While those aren't amazing, the reality is Wright has lightning-fast track speed, and if given a crease, he can hit a dinger. Assuming Achane is out, Wright would likely factor in on early downs, with the trusted veteran, Jeff Wilson, handling passing downs and his share of early downs. Wright can take advantage of this Bills' run defense. Buffalo allowed the third-highest explosive run rate in Week 1. Last year, their run defense was the weak link of their defense, giving up the seventh-highest explosive run rate, the fourth-highest yards after contact per attempt, and the 12th-highest yards per carry to gap runs (Preseason: Wright 50% gap).",NA,NA,"RB50","D-","5.5"

Godwin ran out of the slot on 50% of his snaps, which was a little low, considering all of the off-season reports discussing his return to heavy slot usage. I do think that probably ticks up, depending on the matchups moving forward. Detroit had the ninth-highest single high usage last week (60.8%).
