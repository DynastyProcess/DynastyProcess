Kamara's per-touch efficiency was frightening, with only a 7% missed tackles per attempt rate and 1.93 yards after contact per attempt. Kamara's tackle-breaking metrics were horrendous last year as well, so this isn't just me freaking out over a one-game sample. Kamara could struggle to find room to operate this week against a Dallas run defense that allowed the 13th-lowest explosive run rate; the second-lowest missed tackles per attempt, and the 10th-lowest yards after contact per attempt last year.",NA,NA,"RB9","A","15.9"

His touchdown saved his fantasy day, but his 46% snap rate and lack of pass-game involvement were concerning. Henry only played 33.3% of the passing down snaps as Justice Hill gobbled up all the passing game work. Unless this changes, Henry will be an extremely game script-dependent back for 2024. Henry only forced missed tackles on 8% of his rushing attempts with 1.77 yards after contact per attempt in Week 1. Neither of these numbers are fantastic by any stretch of the imagination, but let's keep it real. It was one game, so don't hit the panic button just yet. The Ravens are heavy favorites this week, so Henry should get more work in Week 2. If the Raiders are as bad as their Week 1 showing as a run defense, they could be in trouble this year. Las Vegas allowed 176 rushing yards (fourth-most) while also giving up the ninth-highest explosive run rate and the 13th-highest yards after contact per attempt.

Sadly, he didn't score in Week 1, but his red zone usage was slightly encouraging. Yes, he only accounted for 33% of this red zone touch usage in this offense, but he clearly led the running back room with three opportunities (Ray Davis and Ty Johnson each one). Cook also received the only carry inside the five-yard line while he split the inside the ten-yard line work with Allen (two rushing attempts for each). Cook also dominated the red zone snaps for the backs with 52.9%. Among 34 qualifying backs, Cook ranked 15th in explosive run rate and 11th in missed tackles forced per attempt in Week 1. Miami's Week 1 showing as a run defense gives Cook hope. Last week, the Dolphins allowed the eighth-highest explosive run rate and the 11th-highest missed tackle rate. This stands opposed to their 2023 ranks, where they were stifling to rushing attacks, holding teams to bottom five metrics in explosive run rate, missed tackles, and yards after contact per attempt. Also worth noting is that in Week 1, 58% of Cook's runs were with zone plays, and last year, Miami allowed the 11th-highest success rate to zone runs.",NA,NA,"RB11","A-","15.7"

Wright is a dice roll flex this week if Achane is out. If Achane is active, then Wright isn't on the fantasy viability radar because his role would be up in the air and could just be a handful of snaps. This preseason, Wright handled 17 carries, which he turned into 91 rushing yards (5.4 ypc). Those numbers look better than his per-touch efficiency. Among 108 preseason rushers, Wright ranked 52nd in yards after contact per attempt and 58th in elusive rating. While those aren't amazing, the reality is Wright has lightning-fast track speed, and if given a crease, he can hit a dinger. Assuming Achane is out, Wright would likely factor in on early downs, with the trusted veteran, Jeff Wilson, handling passing downs and his share of early downs. Wright can take advantage of this Bills' run defense. Buffalo allowed the third-highest explosive run rate in Week 1. Last year, their run defense was the weak link of their defense, giving up the seventh-highest explosive run rate, the fourth-highest yards after contact per attempt, and the 12th-highest yards per carry to gap runs (Preseason: Wright 50% gap).",NA,NA,"RB49","D-","5.8"
