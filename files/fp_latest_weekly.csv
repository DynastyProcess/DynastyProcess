The big takeaway is that Hockenson tied for the 4th-most targets at the TE position in week four and that's what fantasy managers should be focusing in on. At a position group where so many other people are chasing touchdown volatility, etc. it's a huge positional advantage to have one of the target leaders.

With that being said, there are still reasons to be optimistic on Pitts and his fantasy outlook moving forward.
