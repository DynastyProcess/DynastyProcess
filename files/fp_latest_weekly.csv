Barton is an LB2 option when he is at his best and seeing close to every snap but should probably be viewed as more of an LB3 due to week-to-week role uncertainty.

Diggs has now put together back-to-back strong weeks, but the suggestion here is to avoid chasing his last two outings, at least not on a light bye. Give him one more week to prove that his improved play is not just an extended peak for a player known more for his IDP lows than his highs. Treat him as no more than a DB4 option for Week 13 with a tough matchup on tap against a Los Angeles Rams team limiting the safety position to the fewest fantasy points per game.","sit",NA,"S53",NA,"8.6"
