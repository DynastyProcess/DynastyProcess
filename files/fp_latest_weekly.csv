Rivers has 2.11 yards after contact per attempt and a 30.2 PFF elusive rating with zero missed tackles forced. With the backfield split in three different ways and each back running behind an offensive line that's bottom-three in every line yard metric I value, none of these players are more than disgusting low-end flex plays.","sit",NA,"RB48","D","4.7"

He leads all wide receivers in PFF receiving grade and yards per route run (minimum 15 targets). While he's first in deep targets, the only small issue you can poke in his armor is that he has one red zone target and two touchdowns all season. With this type of astronomical profile, it's only a matter of time before the touchdowns come. He'll run about 57% of his routes against Kindle Vildor (61.3% catch rate, 81.7 passer rating) and Jaylon Johnson (56.3% catch rate, 80.2 passer rating). All I can say is good luck, guys.

Diggs is tenth in target share (28.7%) and 20th in air yard share (34.1%). He's 15th in deep targets and second in red zone looks. Diggs is second in PFF receiving grade to only Tyreek Hill and third in yards per route run behind Hill and DeAndre Hopkins (minimum 15 targets).

The man who Von Miller tapped as being special upon his arrival to the Bills has not disappointed and looks to be on his way to a Pro Bowl appearance, despite playing rotation-level snaps. The Bills continue to pull Von and Rousseau when they are up big, so the young pass rusher has never played more than 67 percent of the snaps and has been under 50 percent in three of seven contests. Big G tallied three solos, one assist, one sack, and one tackle for loss on 56 percent of the snaps, his highest mark since the thriller against the Baltimore Ravens. Treat Rousseau as an elite DL2 for a plus Week 9 matchup against a New York Jets offense allowing the 18th most fantasy points to the defensive end position.","start",NA,"DE8",NA,"14.2"

However, he has played just 40 combined snaps over the last two weeks, which is less than he saw in Week 1 or Week 2. The snap share has climbed from 27 percent to 35 percent, but we would like to see him a little higher before trotting him out there on a weekly basis. With that said, Jason Pierre-Paul is now on the team and is a superior run defender, so we may see Houston stuck under 50 percent going forward. With that said, Houston is as hot as anyone and has at least one sack in four of five games this season. Treat him as a low-floor DL2 option against the Saints this weekend.
