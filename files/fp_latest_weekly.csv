Zaire did return to a limited practice on Thursday, but without a full practice on Friday, he will likely be slapped with the questionable tag and will be a real risk for being inactive as the Colts have no reason to rush him back and risk aggravating the injury in what amounts to a lost season in a loaded AFC and with the Jacksonville Jaguars running away with the division. If Olubi starts, he will be an easy LB3 play. He finished Week 9 with four solos, two assists, one interception, and one pass defended, showing flashes of why he got the nod over former All-Pro Shaq Leonard.","start",NA,"LB58",NA,"11.5"
