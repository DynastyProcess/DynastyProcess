The team only had one snap in the red zone in the second half, so I wouldn't go nuts with that fact. I expect Mattison to handle the early down work this week and get some red zone snaps, but the game script will likely dictate how much red zone usage he sees.

If you had to depend on him last week in fantasy, I'm sorry. He played only 46% of the snaps and didn't even draw a target. If I told you that the Bills would post 48 points against the Lions, I don't know if anyone would have guessed that Cooper would do absolutely nothing, especially coming off his Week 14 performance. Since Week 9, New England has had the fifth-highest single-high rate (61.8%). Since Week 7, against single-high, Cooper has had a 29% TPRR, 1.55 YPRR, and a 21.5% first-read share (second on the team). Since Week 10, New England has limited boundary receivers to the 14th-fewest PPR points per target and the seventh-fewest receiving yards per game. Cooper may get shadowed this week as well by Christian Gonzalez. Last week, Gonzalez followed Marvin Harrison Jr. on 73.3% of his routes, holding him to one catch and 23 receiving yards in his primary coverage.","sit",NA,"WR49","C-","9.8"

This season against single high, Coleman has had an 18% TPRR and a team-leading 2.94 YPRR while also ranking second in FD/RR (0.110). I don't see Coleman seeing Christian Gonzalez much this week. If Cooper is out there, I expect Gonzalez to follow him. Every corner on New England's roster without the last name of Gonzalez has been league-average or worse this season. That's why, despite how good Gonzalez has been, New England has still allowed the 11th-most PPR points per target to perimeter wide receivers.

I don't know if Thompson-Robinson can support even one viable fantasy receiving option this week, much less multiple ones. Tillman is a must-sit.",NA,NA,"WR100","F","3.8"
