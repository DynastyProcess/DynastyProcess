Jones saw 97 percent of the snaps in Week 5, a week after seeing just 39 percent against Cincinnati Bengals. It seems like his snaps may be inconsistent, as he has seen over 90 percent of the snaps in three of his five games, with a 64 percent share and the aforementioned 39 percent also in the mix. Jones is a better pure talent than Eric Rowe, but there must be some packages they prefer Rowe in. Regardless, Jones is back in the DB2 mix for the byes, including this week against the Minnesota Vikings. The matchup is not a good one in terms of fantasy points against, but Jones will see heavy snaps in the box, making the 12 solos we saw from the Bears safeties a comfortable floor to project Jones and Jevon Holland hitting this week. Start Holland as a DB1 option where possible.",NA,NA,"S15",NA,"13.8"

Stone, noted for his versatility when coming into the league, can become an instant IDP force, especially if they deploy him like they did Williams, the DB4 overall, despite missing half of Week 5. You will likely not need to plug him in as anything more than a DB3 for Week 6, but Stone is a sneaky DB2 option for a plus matchup against a New York Giants team surrendering the 10th most fantasy points to the position.","start",NA,"S58",NA,"9.7"
