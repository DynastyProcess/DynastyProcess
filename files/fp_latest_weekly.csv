I'm not worried about Ke'Shawn Vaughn and company eating into Taylor Jr.'s workload this week. Taylor Jr.'s yards after contact per attempt (2.14) this season doesn't inspire a ton of hope for upside, but his career mark in that category (2.70) with 82 career carries does help to ease some fears of two yards and a cloud of dust all day when he gets handed the ball. Taylor Jr. should have 15-17 opportunities this week with a lock on the red zone opportunities. He has a nice rushing matchup to chew on this week. Since Week 10, Miami has allowed the sixth-highest missed tackle rate, the fourth-highest explosive run rate, and the fifth-highest yards after contact per attempt.

If Cooper is out there, I expect Gonzalez to follow him. Every corner on New England's roster without the last name of Gonzalez has been league-average or worse this season. That's why, despite how good Gonzalez has been, New England has still allowed the 11th-most PPR points per target to perimeter wide receivers.
