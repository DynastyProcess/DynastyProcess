Without any sort of rushing ability, plus New England's commitment to their run game, there's virtually no upside with Jones unless they get engaged in a true shootout. With the way Tennessee has been playing recently, that's unlikely to happen here and we could see the Patriots lean on the run again. Jones is a fine option as a low-end QB2 that's unlikely to hurt your lineup, but he's not going to help push your Superflex roster over the top either.","sit",NA,"QB19","D+","16.5"

A lot of people are optimistic that OBJ can return to something close to his old form in a potent Rams passing game. It's worth remembering, however, that Beckham has been dealing with injuries to both shoulders and may not be fully healthy again for the rest of the season. Beckham also has to process a new system and get in sync with QB Matthew Stafford, though perhaps the bye week helped with that. Beckham lands at WR41 in this week's rankings.","sit",NA,"WR42","C","10.4"

They've had a slew of tough matchups at the position with very talented players and it's quite shocking that they're only allowing 11.1 fantasy points per game.
