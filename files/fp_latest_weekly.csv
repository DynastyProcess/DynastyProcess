He's getting workhorse treatment, but his tackle-breaking isn't anything to write home about. Mattison has a 13% missed tackle rate and 2.28 yards after contact per attempt. Both of these values are snooze-worthy and have backup-level quality. Mattison should retain his heavy workload this week but don't expect results similar to those in Week 7.

There are plenty of unknowns in this situation, which makes Tracy Jr. difficult to trust in fantasy in Week 8. Last week, he played 67% of the snaps with nine touches and 32 total yards. He did also have 100% of the red zone snaps, but again, the team only had two snaps inside the 20-yard line, so we're dealing with an incredibly small sample size here.

I don't expect Ekeler to have much success on the ground against a run defense that has held backs to the second-lowest missed tackle rate, the 11th-fewest rushing yards per game, and the seventh-lowest yards after contact per attempt.

Now, it was only a seven-snap sample, so let's not get carried away here. It was encouraging to see that Achane didn't hog all the red zone work. Mostert didn't look a ton better as a rusher last week. Yes, he posted an 18% missed tackle rate, but he had zero explosive runs and only 1.45 yards after contact per attempt. Mostert has seen his fantasy stock water down to be a touchdown-dependent flex/RB3. He could pay off this week, though, with a great rushing matchup that could help fluff his boxscore.
