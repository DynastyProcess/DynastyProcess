Last week, White posted respectable per-touch efficiency numbers with a 5.9% explosive run rate and 2.76 yards after contact per attempt. If he draws the start, White should find plenty of running room this week against a Kansas City run defense that, since Week 10, has allowed the 11th-highest explosive run rate, the second-highest rushing touchdown rate, and the ninth-highest yards after contact per attempt.
