Robinson is also losing valuable red zone work to Tyler Allgeier, who has more red zone opportunities than Robinson this season and over the last two weeks. Does it make sense? No, but this is where we are. The biggest problem ailing Robinson isn't even any of the thorns that I've already discussed. It's his offensive line. They went from blowing the doors off of defensive lines to not being able to stop a light breeze. The offensive line's yards before contact per attempt have been the fourth-lowest in the NFL since Week 5. Robinson's tackle-breaking metrics have remained stable, if not become even more impressive, as he's had to create everything on his own. Tampa Bay has been a stout run defense, but there's an avenue for Robinson to be productive if his offensive line can do him any favors. The Buccaneers have kept backs in check, yielding the seventh-lowest explosive run rate and ninth-lowest missed tackles per attempt. They also have the 11th-best stuff rate. The one area of vulnerability for Tampa Bay has been defending zone runs. They have allowed the tenth-highest yards per carry and the sixth-highest success rate to zone run concepts (Robinson 65% zone). Continue to trot out Robinson as an RB1.

Dodson and Terrel Bernard were battling for the spot beside Milano this offseason, so it was Williams who was Milano's direct backup and got the tap over the veteran despite his inexperience. He rewarded the Bills with an excellent performance and, in turn, has probably locked up the role until further notice.
