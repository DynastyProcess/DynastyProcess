Last week against Chicago, Indy allowed only 63 rushing yards with zero explosive runs, a 14% missed tackle rate, and 1.79 yards after contact per attempt. Chicagoâs offensive line has the second-lowest yards before contact per attempt generated.

Last week, Swift played a season-low 53% of the snaps, accruing 15 touches while producing a middling 42 total yards. Swift led the way with a 56% snap rate on rushing plays, but Johnson cut into his passing down role (51% of snaps vs. 42% for Johnson). Swift was also a distant second among the backs in the red zone with a 29% snap rate (Johnson 47%). It's not hard to see why the Bears are looking to other backs for answers. Among 49 qualifying backs, Swift ranks 34th in explosive run rate, 42nd in missed tackles forced per attempt, and 49th in yards after contact per attempt. Swift has a good matchup on the ground again this week, but I highly doubt that he can take advantage of it.

No receiving threat in the Cleveland offense will have sparkling efficiency numbers because the level of quarterback play has been so bad. I'm not attempting to excuse Jeudy here, but it's the truth. Watson is a backup-level quarterback at this juncture. The Raiders have the 10th-highest single-high rate in the NFL (57.1%). Against single-high, Jeudy's target share has dipped a tad to 16.4% while his first-read share has stayed consistent at 18.2%, so this coverage matchup does nothing to boost his Week 4 outlook as a meh-level flex play. The matchup is good, though, for what it's worth. The Raiders' secondary has allowed the ninth-most fantasy points per game to wide receivers.

Unfortunately, most people don't have better starting options at tight end, and the entire position is a wasteland, so if you have to start him, I get it. In the previous two games, Andrews at least had a 69% route share, but he still only managed a 9.3% target share, 1.05 YPRR, a 13.3% first-read share, and 6.3 fantasy points per game.
