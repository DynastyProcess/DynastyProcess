Released. Javian Hawkins, an undrafted rookie free agent? Nope. Released. It looks like I was right about someone stepping forward to share the load with Davis, but I picked the wrong guy.

This trio will be facing a Carolina defense that has allowed a league-low 93 rushing yards per game and just 2.7 yards per carry. Ingram has 40 carries on the season, while Lindsay has 13 and Ingram has only nine. But given the likelihood of a negative game script and the probability that rookie QB Davis Mills will be looking to check down when the Panthers turn up the heat, Johnson has some appeal in DraftKings' Thursday-night Showdown, since at $8,100 he's $1,800 cheaper than Ingram and $600 cheaper than Lindsay.
