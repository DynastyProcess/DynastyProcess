The premiere pass rusher notched five solos, three assists, three sacks, and three tackles for loss while generating six total pressures. Hunter leads the NFL in sacks through two weeks of action with four and also leads with five tackles for loss. The former All-Pro has tallied double-digit sacks in three of the last four seasons. The one year he failed to reach double digits, he had six sacks in seven games played. Suffice it to say that Hunter should be viewed as someone in the same tier as other Yahoo LB-only players like T.J. Watt and Micah Parsons. But if you cannot fathom that, he should at least be considered where names like Josh Allen, Hasson Reddick, and Matt Judon are. A DL1/LB2 option on a weekly basis, Hunter should be treated as such for Week 3.",NA,NA,"DE4",NA,"15.3"

As we see with the other top DT options, being consistent in the tackle department can make them as, if not more valuable, than some, if not most, of their defensive line counterparts. Phillips followed up a surprising five solo, three assist effort in Week 1 with a value-cementing seven solos, six assists, and 0.5 sacks on Thursday Night Football. It is entirely possible that these end up as his top two fantasy games of the season, but at this point, he is playing far too productively to ignore.

Morrow played more snaps than Zach Cunningham and should be more active in the box score once he gets more familiar with the defensive scheme.

He did extend his sack streak to two games and climb to three on the season, which makes him someone IDP managers need to pay attention to, especially in deeper leagues. As mentioned last week, before being lost on special teams, Gardeck recorded seven sacks in 2021, so there is a history of production that suggests that this is not a fluke.
