In Weeks 12-15, McLaughlin played 24-36% of the snaps weekly while leading the way with 44% of the rushing play snaps but only seeing 24% of the red zone snaps. During these three games, he averaged 10.6 touches and 54 total yards. Since Week 12, he has had a 10.7% explosive run rate and an 18% missed tackle rate, which has been strong numbers for the Denver backfield. McLaughlin is a decent flex play this week, but there's a low floor and tons of risk that come along with playing him. The Denver backfield is a dice roll weekly that usually doesn't end up paying off. Since Week 11, Cincy has allowed the 11th-most rushing yards per game, the second-highest explosive run rate, and the eighth-highest yards after contact per attempt.",NA,NA,"RB59","F","3.6"

Since Week 8, against single-high, Waddle has had a 12.4% target share, 1.89 YPRR, and a 14.8% first-read share. Waddle is an iffy flex play this week because of Miami's heavy reliance on Hill all year, especially against single high. If Miami gives Waddle the volume, he'll produce, but we've seen too many weeks of him disappearing in this offense.
