Coleman ran hot with touchdowns as his efficiency metrics more closely resemble a washed-up 29-year-old running back. He's only managed 1.00 yards after contact per attempt with his eight rushing attempts while failing to register any missed tackles forced.

Hendrickson played over 83 percent of the snaps in three of five games this season but is going to be hard to trust if he can drop to 63 percent or below without any notice. The most concerning part is that he is losing snaps to Cameron Sample and not dynasty darling Joseph Ossai. Sample is better as a run-stopper, which means Hendrickson may see a reduced role on early downs going forward. This is a disturbing development for a player who was already pretty sack-dependent. He is still in the DL2 conversation but should no longer be tapped as a DL1 option. With a tough matchup against his former team on tap for Week 6, Hendrickson should be viewed as more of a DL3 option than a DL2. Keep him benched if you are required to start fewer than three DLs weekly.",NA,NA,"DE5",NA,"15.3"

It seems like his snaps may be inconsistent, as he has seen over 90 percent of the snaps in three of his five games, with a 64 percent share and the aforementioned 39 percent also in the mix. Jones is a better pure talent than Eric Rowe, but there must be some packages they prefer Rowe in. Regardless, Jones is back in the DB2 mix for the byes, including this week against the Minnesota Vikings. The matchup is not a good one in terms of fantasy points against, but Jones will see heavy snaps in the box, making the 12 solos we saw from the Bears safeties a comfortable floor to project Jones and Jevon Holland hitting this week. Start Holland as a DB1 option where possible.",NA,NA,"S15",NA,"13.8"

Stone, noted for his versatility when coming into the league, can become an instant IDP force, especially if they deploy him like they did Williams, the DB4 overall, despite missing half of Week 5. You will likely not need to plug him in as anything more than a DB3 for Week 6, but Stone is a sneaky DB2 option for a plus matchup against a New York Giants team surrendering the 10th most fantasy points to the position.","start",NA,"S44",NA,"10.7"
