Ingram had 10 rush attempts for just 28 yards against Dallas and he added one receptions for -2 yards. Now, we're likely to see Kamara come back into the lineup, which eliminates the upside Ingram has in this particular matchup against the Jets. If Kamara plays, we can move Ingram back into high-end RB3 territory in our Week 14 rankings. If Kamara isn't ready to come back yet though, Ingram would move back into top-15 territory purely because of the enticing matchup.",NA,NA
