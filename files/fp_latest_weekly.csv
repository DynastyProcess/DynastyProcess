While the likely outcome is Montgomery soaks up most of Herbert's volume, it's possible Ebner can work into the mix and eat away 8-10 touches weekly. Unlike Herbert, Ebner has a strong receiving acumen which could lead to him working into the passing downs more than Herbert ever did.","sit",NA,"RB56","F","3.8"

A DT1/DL2 mainstay when healthy, Williams racked up five solos, four assists, 0.5 sacks, and a forced fumble in Week 10. He has posted back-to-back five solo outings, a sign that he is ready to produce like the monster, run-stuffing defensive tackle we all know and love. He has 1.5 sacks over his last two games, but with Williams, his value comes from his tackle consistency. Start him as a DT1/DL2 option for Week 11.","start",NA,"DE11",NA,"13.1"

Forrest responded by posting three solos, three assists, one interception, one pass defended, and one fumble recovery. McCain is more suited for high-level slot play than practice squader Danny Johnson, so this is a package that the Commanders may lean on going forward. Forrest is not without some risk for Week 11 but was still seeing roughly 60 percent of the snaps in the previous few weeks, making him someone for those in a bye-week crunch to lean on. Treat him as a low-floor DB3 option for a neutral Week 11 matchup against a Houston Texans team allowing the 19th most fantasy points per game to the position.","start",NA,"S40",NA,"11.6"
