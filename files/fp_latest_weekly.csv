Give him one more week to prove that his improved play is not just an extended peak for a player known more for his IDP lows than his highs. Treat him as no more than a DB4 option for Week 13 with a tough matchup on tap against a Los Angeles Rams team limiting the safety position to the fewest fantasy points per game.","sit",NA,"S53",NA,"8.7"
