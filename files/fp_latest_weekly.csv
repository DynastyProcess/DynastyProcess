With a couple more weeks of data, we can start to ascertain what his role may be going forward, but for now, the advice is to keep him on your radar but not to chase the six solos and two assists he managed last week against the Atlanta Falcons. Talent dictates that he is a hold in deeper leagues, especially those with more than 12 teams, but he should remain on benches for at least one more week.","sit",NA,"S45",NA,"11.0"

He saw three snaps in Week 2, an improvement from the zero defensive snaps he saw in Week 1. The thought was that he would get the first crack at starting, but for now, at least, he is just a depth reserve, not even a rotational player. He is extremely productive from an IDP standpoint when he is on the field and getting regular snaps, so I get the appeal, but outside of the deepest of leagues and/or dynasty leagues, it is fair to question whether he even warrants a roster spot at this juncture of the season. Stash him if you can afford it, otherwise cut him loose in favor of someone who is actually in his team's weekly defensive gameplan.","sit",NA,"S72",NA,"9.1"
