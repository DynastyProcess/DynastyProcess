Based on his stats up to this point, Henry is now on pace for 480 rush attempts, 2,168 rushing yards, 17 rushing touchdowns, 55 targets, 51 receptions, 446 receiving yards, and zero receiving touchdowns. It's absurd how good Henry is and the type of volume that he receives any given week. In a matchup that he has historically dominated in (Henry has faced the Jaguars 10 times in his career and has ran for over 150 yards in three of those games), he's a no-brainer start as the consensus RB1.

He had three other performances up to this point where he saw one target, but this is the first game ever where Kamara was not even involved in the receiving game. However, Kamara's 26 carries in week four of the 2021 NFL season were the most he has ever seen in his entire NFL career up to this point as well. Kamara has apparently turned into Derrick Henry and that was something that I was not even remotely prepared for coming into this season. In all seriousness, Kamara continues to get the job done for fantasy football despite the wacky usage. It might not be to the level that we anticipated coming into the season as he's just the RB14 on the season in Half PPR scoring, but he's still providing a high floor for fantasy managers at a position group where people are desperately searching for that. Against a Washington defense that's allowing the 10th most fantasy points to opposing RBs, plus 1.2 receiving touchdowns to the position per game so far, Kamara should be in line for a big performance here.",NA,NA

He's been an incredibly consistent option for fantasy rosters and he's receiving as significant of a workload as fantasy managers hoped for this off-season with Jamaal Williams out of town. The Cincinnati Bengals have only allowed 63.8 rushing yards per game to opposing RBs so far this season, but they're allowing 8.0 receptions and 47.5 receiving yards per game as well.

In 10 games last season, Ekeler had only 18 red zone rush attempts on the year. Through four weeks of 2021, Ekeler is already up to 12 attempts inside the 20-yard line. He's continuing to produce at a very high level for fantasy rosters and there's very little reason why we shouldn't be talking about Ekeler as a top-5 RB for the rest of the season. This matchup against Cleveland is daunting for opposing RBs, but Ekeler's producing at such a high level currently that it's not worth downgrading him in the slightest.

Does the Broncos' defense crack based on Pittsburgh's offense? Or do they stand strong and continue to prevent RBs from doing much?

The Bills are allowing just 97.2 yards per contest and only 10.0 fantasy points per game to the position. This number is skewed by the fact that they faced the Texans in week four, but this is still one of the most stout secondaries in the game and they're going to have a plan for how to contain Hill.

We're now through four weeks of the 2021 season and Moore is already close to breaking through that four touchdown ceiling. He has three so far on the season and he's now the WR4 in all of fantasy football. He is currently on pace for 178.5 targets, 127.5 receptions, 1,691.5 receiving yards, and 12.75 touchdowns. We know that those numbers are going to come down as the season progresses, but it's absolutely absurd what he's doing on the football field. In a matchup that just had Tyreek Hill roll for three touchdowns, Moore belongs in your starting lineup as a top-10 option this week.

While this hasn't translated to a ton of volume over the past two weeks with Fields throwing the ball just 37 total times, it's still an encouraging number to see. Additionally, Dalton could be returning to the Bears lineup as early as this next week, which should mean good things for Robinson as his only touchdown of the season came from Dalton in week two. With Montgomery out for the next several weeks, we could see the Bears lean on their passing game a little bit more as well, which could open up the overall volume for Robinson. He's certainly not a locked-in WR2 like we thought he was going to be coming into the season, but there are still reasons to have Robinson in your starting lineups this week against the Raiders. He can be viewed as a high-end FLEX play in a tougher matchup.","sit",NA
