He played 52% of the snaps (influenced by the blowout) with 20 touches and 110 total yards. While all of that is amazing, it could be false window dressing. Kamara's per-touch efficiency was frightening, with only a 7% missed tackles per attempt rate and 1.93 yards after contact per attempt. Kamara's tackle-breaking metrics were horrendous last year as well, so this isn't just me freaking out over a one-game sample.

His touchdown saved his fantasy day, but his 46% snap rate and lack of pass-game involvement were concerning. Henry only played 33.3% of the passing down snaps as Justice Hill gobbled up all the passing game work. Unless this changes, Henry will be an extremely game script-dependent back for 2024. Henry only forced missed tackles on 8% of his rushing attempts with 1.77 yards after contact per attempt in Week 1. Neither of these numbers are fantastic by any stretch of the imagination, but let's keep it real. It was one game, so don't hit the panic button just yet. The Ravens are heavy favorites this week, so Henry should get more work in Week 2. If the Raiders are as bad as their Week 1 showing as a run defense, they could be in trouble this year. Las Vegas allowed 176 rushing yards (fourth-most) while also giving up the ninth-highest explosive run rate and the 13th-highest yards after contact per attempt.

McLaughlin was still effective with the work that he received on early downs, ranking 16th in missed tackles forced per attempt and 17th in yards after contact per attempt (among 40 qualifying backs). Yes, I know you're wondering how I can say this, looking at his box score, but his offensive line only managed 0.20 yards before contact per attempt on his carries. Basically, as soon as he got the ball, a defender was already in his face. It's nearly impossible to expect a back to produce in any offense when that's the case every snap. Overall, McLaughlin played 35% of the snaps with 15 touches and 28 total yards. If Nix can provide decent quarterback play, we could see McLaughlin's numbers improve in Week 2.",NA,NA,"RB34","C","10.6"

White did have a stranglehold on the early down work with a 68% snap rate on rushing plays. On paper, White's rushing matchup against Baltimore doesn't look imposing. Last week, Baltimore ranked 15th in explosive run rate allowed and stuff rate while giving up the fifth-most missed tackles per attempt. A lot of these numbers track with their 2023 performance, as the Ravens allowed the 13th-highest explosive run rate and the eighth-highest missed tackles per attempt last year.

Wright is a dice roll flex this week if Achane is out. If Achane is active, then Wright isn't on the fantasy viability radar because his role would be up in the air and could just be a handful of snaps. This preseason, Wright handled 17 carries, which he turned into 91 rushing yards (5.4 ypc). Those numbers look better than his per-touch efficiency. Among 108 preseason rushers, Wright ranked 52nd in yards after contact per attempt and 58th in elusive rating. While those aren't amazing, the reality is Wright has lightning-fast track speed, and if given a crease, he can hit a dinger. Assuming Achane is out, Wright would likely factor in on early downs, with the trusted veteran, Jeff Wilson, handling passing downs and his share of early downs. Wright can take advantage of this Bills' run defense. Buffalo allowed the third-highest explosive run rate in Week 1. Last year, their run defense was the weak link of their defense, giving up the seventh-highest explosive run rate, the fourth-highest yards after contact per attempt, and the 12th-highest yards per carry to gap runs (Preseason: Wright 50% gap).",NA,NA,"RB49","D-","6.1"

Despite this, it surprised me that Kraft was Green Bay's clear starter at tight end in Week 1. He had a 56.8% route run rate, an 8.6% target share, 1.76 YPRR, and a 4.2% first-read share. He entered the game banged up, which could also account for the route run rate not being higher. Kraft is a dart throw only, though, this week with Malik Willis under center. The entire passing attack is in question. This is a good matchup for Kraft, though, if Willis can somehow provide competent quarterback play. Last year, Indy allowed the 10th-most receiving yards and fantasy points to tight ends.","sit",NA,"TE23","F","6.3"
