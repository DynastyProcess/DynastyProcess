Montgomery continues to play a big role in the Chicago offense, with 36 carries through two games. He's also caught 4 of 5 targets. It will be interesting to see how the QB change affects Montgomery's production. Conventional wisdom suggests that a mobile quarterback who poses a running threat will make things easier for his running backs, since on zone-read plays, linebackers can't overcommit to the running back for fear of letting the quarterback dash past them. But mobile quarterbacks also tend to check the ball down to their running backs less often in the passing game. For what it's worth, the primary RBs at Ohio State during Fields' two seasons there, J.K. Dobbins in 2019 and Trey Sermon in 2020, collectively averaged 1.6 receptions per game with Fields at quarterback. With receiving expectations for Montgomery lowered in Fields' first start, I'm not interested in using him in DFS, but I have no issue starting him as usual in redraft.",NA,NA

Released. Javian Hawkins, an undrafted rookie free agent? Nope. Released. It looks like I was right about someone stepping forward to share the load with Davis, but I picked the wrong guy. I thought it would be Wayne Gallman, signed earlier this month. Gallman's NFL credentials aren't unlike those of Davis, and I thought they might split the workload almost evenly. Nope. Gallman hasn't suited up yet. It turns out the 1b to Davis's 1a was under our noses the whole time: Cordarrelle Patterson. We can be forgiven for not recognizing a 30-year-old converted wide receiver/kick returner as a potential RB asset, even though he backed up David Montgomery in Chicago last year after Tarik Cohen got hurt. Through two games, Patterson has 14-65-1 as a runner and 7-71-1 as a receiver. That makes him the RB10 in fantasy scoring (half-point PPR) or the WR21, depending on where your league has him eligible. Davis, meanwhile, is the RB30. He's collected 135 yards from scrimmage but hasn't found the end zone. The Falcons' passing game has mostly been a sinkhole, but head coach Arthur Smith is creating RB value in Atlanta. Maybe Patterson's usage won't stick, but someone has to share this backfield with Davis, and Patterson has done a pretty nice job of it so far. I have him ranked RB35 and WR44 this week.

The reason he was being projected for so many touches was the absence of obvious challengers on the Falcons' roster. Qadree Ollison, who hadn't flashed in two previous seasons in Atlanta? Nope. Released. Javian Hawkins, an undrafted rookie free agent? Nope. Released. It looks like I was right about someone stepping forward to share the load with Davis, but I picked the wrong guy. I thought it would be Wayne Gallman, signed earlier this month. Gallman's NFL credentials aren't unlike those of Davis, and I thought they might split the workload almost evenly. Nope. Gallman hasn't suited up yet. It turns out the 1b to Davis's 1a was under our noses the whole time: Cordarrelle Patterson. We can be forgiven for not recognizing a 30-year-old converted wide receiver/kick returner as a potential RB asset, even though he backed up David Montgomery in Chicago last year after Tarik Cohen got hurt. Through two games, Patterson has 14-65-1 as a runner and 7-71-1 as a receiver. That makes him the RB10 in fantasy scoring (half-point PPR) or the WR21, depending on where your league has him eligible. Davis, meanwhile, is the RB30. He's collected 135 yards from scrimmage but hasn't found the end zone. The Falcons' passing game has mostly been a sinkhole, but head coach Arthur Smith is creating RB value in Atlanta. Maybe Patterson's usage won't stick, but someone has to share this backfield with Davis, and Patterson has done a pretty nice job of it so far. I have him ranked RB35 and WR44 this week. I think I'll be above the expert consensus ranking on Patterson at both positions, but it still feels like a conservative ranking. I have Davis at RB29.",NA,NA

Ingram earned a plurality of snaps in Week 1, when a comfortable win over the Jaguars kept the game script favorable - i.e, run-heavy. But in Week 2, when a game that was 14-14 at halftime got away from Houston in the second half, Johnson led the Texans' backs with 26 snaps. This trio will be facing a Carolina defense that has allowed a league-low 93 rushing yards per game and just 2.7 yards per carry. Ingram has 40 carries on the season, while Lindsay has 13 and Ingram has only nine. But given the likelihood of a negative game script and the probability that rookie QB Davis Mills will be looking to check down when the Panthers turn up the heat, Johnson has some appeal in DraftKings' Thursday-night Showdown, since at $8,100 he's $1,800 cheaper than Ingram and $600 cheaper than Lindsay. But all of these dudes are unusable this week in redraft leagues.",NA,NA

We know Ja'Mycal Hasty will be out for an extended period of time and Trey Sermon is still in the concussion protocol. Additionally, Elijah Mitchell still has a chance to suit up this week after dealing with a shoulder injury, but that's also currently up in the air. The 49ers are bringing in multiple RBs for tryouts and they've also signed Jacques Patrick off of the Bengals practice squad, so this is about as messy of a situation as you can find for fantasy football. If Mitchell is able to play, you can start him as a low-end RB2. Otherwise, it's probably best to just avoid this backfield for the time being.","start",NA
