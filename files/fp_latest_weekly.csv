The man who Von Miller tapped as being special upon his arrival to the Bills has not disappointed and looks to be on his way to a Pro Bowl appearance, despite playing rotation-level snaps. The Bills continue to pull Von and Rousseau when they are up big, so the young pass rusher has never played more than 67 percent of the snaps and has been under 50 percent in three of seven contests. Big G tallied three solos, one assist, one sack, and one tackle for loss on 56 percent of the snaps, his highest mark since the thriller against the Baltimore Ravens. Treat Rousseau as an elite DL2 for a plus Week 9 matchup against a New York Jets offense allowing the 18th most fantasy points to the defensive end position.","start",NA,"DE8",NA,"14.1"

However, he has played just 40 combined snaps over the last two weeks, which is less than he saw in Week 1 or Week 2.
