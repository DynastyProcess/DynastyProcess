He's only drawn a 4.1% target share this year with 0.77 yards per route run. I know you're wondering. Why is he including his name here? It's because Bell will run about 81% of his routes from the slot, which IS the area you attack this secondary at. Brandon Stephens (52% catch rate, 95.3 passer rating) and Damarion Williams (76% catch rate, 141.0 passer rating) have shared slot coverage duties. Bell is a matchup-based flex prayer in deep leagues. Trust the process.",NA,NA,"WR79","F","4.8"

Ebiketie played 82 percent of the snaps in Week 6, tallying three solos, one assist, and one forced fumble. It was his highest snap and solo count of the season, and if he continues to play over 70 percent of the snaps, he becomes an instant DL3 option. Ebiketie was a popular name in dynasty leagues and even redraft circles due to his perceived open path to heavy snaps. It may have taken six weeks to materialize, but it appears that we will finally start to see a return on investment from the rookie edge rusher.

He posted three solos and a sack last week and now has three sacks in his last four games. The prevailing thought was that his role would continue to expand with both Nick Bosa and Arik Armstead sidelined, especially after he played 45 percent of the snaps in Week 5. Unfortunately, Drake actually played a season-low 21 percent of the snaps in Week 6 while seeing Kerry Hyder and Kemoko Turay both see more snaps than him. His talent is obvious, so he should see a permanent role expansion sooner rather than later, but until then, he is going to be hard to trust as more than a DT3/DL5 option. 21 percent of the snaps is simply too low to allow us to trust his usage, even if he has been getting to the quarterback consistently. Keep him benched until the 49ers finally turn him loose.","sit",NA,"DE48",NA,"9.8"

In Week 4, Keanu suddenly played 58 percent of the snaps and tallied six solos after seeing a grand total of three defensive snaps over the first three weeks of the season. Keanu will be back to more of a part-time role this week with Mike Edwards expected back but is still a high-upside, low-floor DB3 option since Logan Ryan is on short-term injured reserve.
