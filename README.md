# DynastyProcess.com Data Repository

This repository contains resources and data for the purpose of supporting apps and developers, and is updated via a script on a weekly basis.

The old database.csv was getting a little unwieldy (80+ columns) so it's been broken down into smaller, more specific pieces.

The main files available are: 

- db_playerids.csv
- values.csv (and sibling files values-players.csv and values-picks.csv)

and a few more to come! 

A number of older files were moved into the `archives/` folder and are likely out of date. 

## Contributing

Many hands make light work, especially when maintaining open data! 

You can open an issue if you'd like to request specific data or report a bug, there are templates to help make your issue clearer.

The main files are updated via a script, but we are accepting pull-requests to supporting files like `missing_playerids.csv` which help fill in any gaps!
